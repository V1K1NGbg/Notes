1.1 Introduction to Set Theory
In this section we will consider some basic concepts in Set Theory. We will start with the
definition of a set:
Definition 1.1. A set is a collection of objects. These objects are called the elements of the
set.
Example 1.2. The Natural numbers N= {1, 2, 3, ... } is a set and the number 20 is an
element of this set. Note that 0 is not an element of N.
Notation:
We will usually use capital letters for sets and lowercase letters for elements of sets.
We write a ∈A if a is an element of the set A.
If b is not an element of A, we write b /∈A.
It is not always easy to specify the elements of a set. If the set A has a small number of
elements, we could list them: for example if A has three elements a, b, and c then we write
A = {a, b, c}
We also took this approach with the set N above. However, sometimes it is not useful or
practical to take this approach and it is clearer to describe a property that specifies the
elements of the set: for example we could describe the set A = {5, 6, 7, ... } as
A = {x ∈N|x > 4}.
Example 1.3. There are often many ways of describing the same set.
Let C = {x ∈N|x2 −3x + 2 = 0}. We can check that C = {1, 2}. We can also see that we
could describe C as {x ∈N|x < 3}.
Definition 1.4. Define the set of Integers as
Z= {0,1,−1,2,−2,3,−3,...}.
The set of Rational numbers as
Q= {p/q |p,q ∈Z,q 6= 0}.
It is not so easy to give a precise definition of the set of Real numbers. For the moment we
will say that the set of real numbers Ris the set of all numbers on the number line.
Notice that given a set A and an element x then exactly one of the following holds: x ∈A;
x /∈A.
1
Definition 1.5. Suppose A and B are both sets and suppose that all elements of A are also
elements of B (that is if x ∈A then x ∈B), then we say A is a subset of B and write A ⊂B.
If in addition there is an element y ∈B which is not an element of A then we say that A is
a proper subset of B.
Example 1.6. 1. The even whole numbers E = {2, 4, 6, 8,... }is a proper subset of N.
2. Consider the set D = {0,1}. Then D ⊂Zbut D is not a subset of N.
3. We have N⊂Z⊂Q⊂R.
Note: If A ⊂B and B ⊂A then A = B. (Can you explain why this is true?)
Set Operations
Definition 1.7. If A and B are sets then their intersection is the set of all elements that
belong to both A and to B. We write A ∩B.
Example 1.8. Let A = {2,4,6,8,10}, B = {6,10,13} and C = {1,13}. Then A ∩B =
{6,10}, B ∩C = {13} and there are no elements in A ∩C.
We write ∅ for the empty set so we have A ∩C = ∅.
Definition 1.9. If A ∩B = ∅ we say that they are non-intersecting or disjoint.
Definition 1.10. If A and B are sets then their union is the set of all elements that belong
to either A or to B or to both. We write A ∪B.
Example 1.11. If we return to the last example we have A∪B = {2,4,6,8,10,13}, B∪C =
{1,6,10,13} and A ∪C = {1,2,4,6,8,10,13}.
Definition 1.12. If A and B are sets then the complement of B in A is the set of elements
of A that are not in B. We denote it as A −B. That is
A −B = {x ∈A|x /∈B}.
Note: In general A −B 6= B −A. For example if B = {6,10,13} and C = {1,13} then
B −C = {6,10} but C −B = {1}. If A −B = B −A, what can you say about A and B?
Definition 1.13. If A is a set then the complement of A is
C(A) = {x|x /∈A}.
Theorem 1.14. Let A, B and C be any sets then
1. A ∩A = A and A ∪A = A (The Idempotent Law)
2. A ∩B = B ∩A and A ∪B = B ∪A (The Commutative Law)
2
3. (A ∩B) ∩C = A ∩(B ∩C) and (A ∪B) ∪C = A ∪(B ∪C) (The Associative Law)
4. A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) and A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C)
(The Distributive Law)
Proof: Let’s prove A∩(B ∪C) = (A∩B) ∪(A∩C) from part 4. We will use the fact that
if X and Y are sets with X ⊂ Y and Y ⊂ X then X = Y . So here we need to show that
A ∩(B ∪C) ⊂(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) and that (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) ⊂A ∩(B ∪C). Recall that
to show X ⊂Y we need to show that for all elements x ∈X we have x ∈Y .
Let x ∈A ∩(B ∪C), then x ∈A and x ∈B ∪C. So x ∈A, and either x ∈B or x ∈C.
Case 1: If x ∈B, then x ∈A and x ∈B so x ∈A ∩B.
Case 2: If x ∈C, then x ∈A and x ∈C so x ∈A ∩C.
So either x ∈A ∩B or x ∈A ∩C. In other words x ∈(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C).
So we have shown that A ∩(B ∪C) ⊂(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C).
Now we need to show that (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) ⊂A ∩(B ∪C).
Let y ∈(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) then either y ∈A ∩B or y ∈A ∩C.
Case 1: If y ∈A ∩B , then y ∈A and y ∈B.
Case 2: If y ∈A ∩C, then y ∈A and y ∈C.
In any case y ∈ A and either y ∈ B or y ∈ C. So y ∈ A and y ∈ B ∪C. In other words
y ∈A ∩(B ∪C).
Thus (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) ⊂A ∩(B ∪C), as required.
We have shown that A∩(B∪C) ⊂(A∩B)∪(A∩C) and that (A∩B)∪(A∩C) ⊂A∩(B∪C).
We conclude that A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C).

Exercise 1.15. Your turn: Prove the rest of the theorem above. Remember to use the fact
that if A ⊂B and B ⊂A then A = B.
Notation: Since by part 3. of the previous theorem A ∩(B ∩C) = (A ∩B) ∩C we often
write it as A ∩B ∩C. Similarly we write A ∪B ∪C for A ∪(B ∪C) = (A ∪B) ∪C.
We can generalise and write:
∩nk=1Ak = A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩... ∩An = {x|x ∈Ak for all k = 1,...,n}.
∪nk=1Ak = A1 ∪A2 ∪A3 ∪... ∪An = {x|x ∈Ak for some k = 1,...,n}.
Similarly we write
∩∞k=1Ak = ∩k∈NAk = {x|x ∈Ak for all k ∈N}.
∪∞k=1Ak = ∪k∈NAk = {x|x ∈Ak for some k ∈N}.
3
Example 1.16. For each k ∈Nlet Ak = [0,k]. So A1 = [0,1], A2 = [0,2] etc. Then
∪nk=1Ak = [0,n]
and
∩nk=1Ak = [0,1].
Also ∪k∈NAk = [0,∞) and ∩k∈NAk = [0,1]. Can you explain why?
Exercise 1.17. Your turn: For each k ∈Nlet Ak = [1/k,1]. Find:
1. ∪k∈NAk;
2. ∩k∈NAk.
Theorem 1.18. Let A, B and C be any sets then
A −(B ∪C) = (A −B) ∩(A −C)
A −(B ∩C) = (A −B) ∪(A −C)
Proof: We will prove that A −(B ∪C) = (A −B) ∩(A −C) and leave the proof of the
second statement as an exercise.
If x ∈A −(B ∪C) then x ∈A and x /∈B ∪C. That means that x ∈A and x /∈B, x /∈C.
Now x ∈A and x /∈B means that x ∈A −B.
And x ∈A and x /∈C means that x ∈A −C.
Thus x ∈(A −B) ∩(A −C).
So we have shown that A −(B ∪C) ⊂(A −B) ∩(A −C). (*)
Now suppose that y ∈(A −B) ∩(A −C). Then y ∈A −B and y ∈A −C.
This means that y ∈A and y /∈B and y /∈C. So y ∈A and y /∈B ∪C.
Thus y ∈A −(B ∪C). Thus we have shown that (A −B) ∩(A −C) ⊂A −(B ∪C). (**)
From (*) and (**) we have A−(B∪C) ⊂(A−B)∩(A−C) and (A−B)∩(A−C) ⊂A−(B∪C),
thus A −(B ∪C) = (A −B) ∩(A −C).

Definition 1.19. If A and B are two non-empty sets then the Cartesian product A ×B of
A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) with a ∈A and b ∈B.
Note that you have seen the Cartesian product of sets many times before. For example
R2 = R×R= {(x,y)|x ∈Rand y ∈R} is the usual xy-plane. Similarly R3 = R×R×R.
Example 1.20. Let A = {1,2,3} and B = {−1,0}. Then
A ×B = {(1,−1),(1,0),(2,−1),(2,0),(3,−1),(3,0)}.

1.2 Functions
You are already very familiar with the concept of functions. The definition given in Calculus
courses is usually:
Definition 1.21. Given two sets A and B, a function from A to B is a rule that associates
to each element of A a single element of B. We write f : A → B. Given x ∈ A, we write
f(x) for the unique element of B associated to it. The set A is called the domain of f and
the range or image of f is the subset of B given by {y ∈B|y = f(x) for some x ∈A}.
Sometimes we can write down a specific formula for a function. For example:
f : R→Rf(x) = x2 −3.
Sometimes we need more than one formula to describe the function. For example, Dirichlet’s
function is:
g : R→Rg(x) =
{
1 x ∈Q
0 x ∈R−Q
Similarly the absolute value function is described as
h(x) = |x|=
{
−x x < 0
x x ≥0
Sometimes we have no ‘formula’ at all. For example, let A = {cat, dog, mouse} and let
B = {house, garden}, then we can define a function f : A →B by f(cat) = house, f(dog) =
garden, and f(mouse) = house. (Check that this satisfies the definition of a function, and
find a different function g : A → B. Can you find an example of a mapping h : A → B
which is not a function? )
There are some problems with the definition of a function given above. It is not precise
enough and therefore open to interpretation. We have a more formal version:
Definition 1.22. Let A and B be sets. A function from A to B is a set f of ordered pairs
in A ×B with the property that if (a,b) and (a,b′) are elements of f then b = b′.
Note: here the domain of f is the set {a ∈A|a appears as the first member of an element of f}.
We usually think of f as a set of pairs (a,f(a)).
Definition 1.23. Suppose f : A → B is a function. Suppose C ⊂ A. We can define the
restriction of f to C as
f|C : C →B given by f|C(x) = f(x) ∀x ∈C.
Example 1.24. Consider the following examples:
1. Let f : R→ Rbe given by f(x) = 3x + 7. Then since Z⊂ Rwe can define the
restriction f|Z: Z→R. We have f|Z(x) = 3x + 7 for all x ∈Z.
5
2. Recall Dirichlet’s Function g : R→Rgiven by g(x) =
{
1 x ∈Q
0 x ∈R−Q.
It is easy to see that g|Q(x) = 1 for all x ∈Q.
Definition 1.25. Suppose f : A → B and g : B → C. We can define the composition
g ◦f : A →C as g ◦f(x) = g(f(x)) for all x such that f(x) is in the domain of g.
Example 1.26. Let f : R→Rbe given by f(x) = 3x + 7. Let g : [0,∞) →Rbe given by
g(x) = √x. We can define g ◦f(x) = √3x + 7 if f(x) = 3x + 7 is in the domain of g; that
is if 3x + 7 ≥0 or x ∈[−7/3,∞).
Injections, Surjections, and Bijections
The concept of a bijection will be very important later in this chapter. We will first consider
the notions of injections and surjections.
Definition 1.27. Let f : A → B be a function. We say that f is injective or one-to-one
(1-1) if whenever f(a1) = f(a2) for any two elements a1,a2 ∈ A then a1 = a2. We say that
f is an injection.
Example 1.28. 1. The function f : R→ Rgiven by f(x) = 3x + 7 is a one-to-one
function since if f(a1) = f(a2) then 3(a1) + 7 = 3(a2) + 7 or 3(a1) = 3(a2) which means
that a1 = a2. Therefore by the definition above we see that f is a one-to-one function.
2. The function g : R→ Rgiven by g(x) = x2 is a not one-to-one function since it
is possible to find a1,a2 ∈ Rwhere g(a1) = g(a2) but a1 6= a2. For instance, let
a1 = −5,a2 = 5 then g(a1) = 25 = g(a2) but a1 = −5 6= 5 = a2.
3. In the example above we could restrict g to the set C = [0,∞) to get a one to one
function g|C : [0,∞) →R. (Check!)
4. Let A = {cat, dog, mouse}and B = {house, garden}, and define a function f : A →B
by f(cat) = house, f(dog) = garden, and f(mouse) = house. Then f is not one-to-one
because f(cat) = f(mouse), but ‘cat’ is not equal to ‘mouse’.
Remark: Note that in order to prove that a function f is one-to-one we need to show that
the definition holds for any pair of elements of the domain of f. However to prove that
f is not one-to-one we just need to find a single pair of elements a and b in A for which
f(a) = f(b) but a 6= b.
Exercise 1.29. Your turn:
1. Find a one-to-one function from Nto the set of even numbers E = {2,4,6,8,...}. Now
find another one!
2. Find a one-to-one function from Nto the set of odd numbers O = {1,3,5,7,...}.
6
Definition 1.30. Let f : A →B be a function. We say that f is surjective or onto if for all
b ∈B there exists a ∈A such thatf(a) = b. We say that f is an surjection.
Note: If f is an onto function then the range of f is all of B.
Example 1.31. 1. The function f : R→ Rgiven by f(x) = 3x + 7 is an onto function
since if y ∈ Rthen there exists x ∈ Rsuch that f(x) = y i.e. x = y−7
3 . Therefore by
the definition above we see that f is an onto function.
2. The function g : R→ Rgiven by g(x) = x2 is a not onto function since it is possible
to find y ∈ Rwhich is not in the range of g; for example if y = −1 then there is no
x ∈Rsuch that g(x) = y.
3. We could modify the example above by considering h : R→[0,∞), h(x) = x2. Check
that h is onto!
Remark: To prove that a function f : A → B is onto we need to show that every y ∈ B
is in the image of f i.e. that there exists x ∈ A such that f(x) = y. To show that f is not
onto we just need to find one y ∈B which is not in the image of f.
Note: It is possible to find examples of functions which are a) both one-to-one and onto b)
neither one-to-one nor onto c) onto but not one-to-one and d) one-to-one but not onto. Try
to come up with examples in each of these categories yourself before looking at the next
example.
Example 1.32. Find examples of functions f : R→Rin the following categories:
1. One-to-one and onto: From our work above we see that f(x) = 3x + 7 is one-to-one
and onto. It is not hard to prove that any non-constant linear function (f(x) = ax+ b
where a 6= 0) is one-to-one and onto.
2. Neither 1-1 nor onto: If we let f(x) = sin(x) then f is not onto (since the range is
[−1,1]) and is not one-to-one (since f(0) = f(2π) etc.)
3. Onto but not one-to-one: The function f(x) = x(x −1)(x −2) = x3 −3x2 + 2x is not
one-to-one since f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0. From its graph we can see that it is onto.
4. One-to-one but not onto: The function f(x) = ex is one-to-one but not onto (from its
graph we can see that it is always increasing and so never takes the same value twice,
and its range is (0,∞)).
Definition 1.33. A function f : A →B is called a bijection if it is one-to-one and onto.
Example 1.34. We have seen above that f : R→Rgiven by f(x) = 3x+7 is one-to-one and
onto, therefore it is a bijection. We can also check that the function f : N→E = {2,4,6,...}
given by f(x) = 2x is a bijection. So we have an example of a bijection between a set and
one of its proper subsets.
7
Exercise 1.35. Your turn: Suppose A and B are finite sets (that is they each contain a
finite number of elements).
1. Suppose that f : A →B is onto. What can you say about the number of elements in
A and B?
2. Suppose that f : A → B is one-to-one. What can you say about the number of
elements in A and B?
3. Suppose that f : A → B is a bijection. What can you say about the number of
elements in A and B?
Exercise 1.36. Is it possible to find a bijection between Nand Z? If so, find it. If not,
explain why it is impossible.
Definition 1.37. Let A be a set. Then the identity function idA is the function given by
idA : A →A where idA(x) = x for all x ∈A.
Definition 1.38. Let A and B be sets. Let f : A → B and g : B → A be functions. We
say that g is the inverse of f if f ◦g = idB and g ◦f = idA. We write g = f−1. (That is
g = f−1 if f(g(b)) = b for all b ∈B, and g(f(a)) = a for all a ∈A.)
We might ask which functions have inverses. The next theorem tells us that all bijections
have inverses.
Theorem 1.39. Let f : A →B be a bijection. Then g = f−1 exists.
Proof: We need to define g : B → A such that g(f(a)) = a for all a ∈ A and f(g(b)) = b
for all b ∈B.
Let b ∈B, then since f is onto there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b. Since f is one-to-one,
there is only one such a. So define g(b) = a.
Then g(f(a)) = g(b) = a for all a ∈ A. And f(g(b)) = f(a) = b for all b ∈ B. Therefore
g = f−1.

Example 1.40. We saw previously that f : R→ Rgiven by f(x) = 3x + 7 is a bijection
and so it has an inverse function. The inverse is g(x) = x−7
3 . Check that f(g(y)) = y and
g(f(x)) = x for all x,y ∈R.
Example 1.41. We have seen above that f : R→Rgiven by f(x) = sin(x) is not a bijection
since it is neither one-to-one nor onto. However if we restrict the domain and the range by
considering f : [−π/2,π/2] → [−1,1] we can check that f is a bijection between the sets
[−π/2,π/2] and [−1,1]. Therefore it has an inverse g(x) = sin−1(x) = arcsin(x) which is
defined on [−1,1].
Theorem 1.42. Let f : A → B be a bijection and g : B → C be a bijection. Then
g ◦f : A →C is a bijection.
8
Proof: We need to show that g ◦f : A →C is one-to-one and onto.
To show that it is one-to-one: Suppose g ◦f(a1) = g ◦f(a2) then g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)).
But since g is one-to-one on B this means that f(a1) = f(a2). But since f is one-to-one on
A we have a1 = a2. Thus g ◦f is one-to-one.
To show that g ◦f : A → C is onto: Let z ∈ C, then there exists y ∈ B such that
g(y) = z since g : B →C is onto. There exists x ∈A such that f(x) = y since f : A →B is
onto. Thus g ◦f(x) = g(f(x)) = g(y) = z, and so g ◦f : A →C is onto.

1.3 Equivalence Relations
Equivalence relations are important in many areas of mathematics. They will be useful to
us when we look at cardinality of sets. We will start with some definitions:
Definition 1.43. A relation on a set A is a subset of A ×A.
Example 1.44. Let P be the set of all people in the world. Remember that a relation on
P is just a subset of P ×P. Let’s consider some relations on P:
D = {(x,y) ∈P ×P | x is a descendant of y};
B = {(x,y) ∈P ×P | x has an ancestor who is an ancestor of y};
S = {(x,y) ∈P ×P | x has the same parents as y};
If (x,y) is an element of a relation we usually write x ∼y. We will concentrate on relations
with some nice properties:
Definition 1.45. An equivalence relation on a set A is a relation ∼ which satisfies:
1. x ∼x for all x ∈A (Reflexivity);
2. If x ∼y then y ∼x for all x,y ∈A (Symmetry);
3. If x ∼y and y ∼z then x ∼z for all x,y,z ∈A (Transitivity).
Let’s consider the relations in Example 1.44 above. Are any of them equivalence relations?
Example 1.44 (continued). Let’s start with the relation D. We need to check if it is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
In order to be reflexive we need x ∼x for all x ∈P. But x ∼x means that x is a descendant
of themselves (which is clearly impossible!) so this relation is not reflexive. This tells us that
the relation D is not an equivalence relation.
Is D symmetric? We need to check that if x ∼y then y ∼x, for all x,y ∈P. If x ∼y then
x is a descendant of y, but that means that y could not be a descendant of x so D is not
symmetric.
9
Is D transitive? We need to check that if x ∼y and y ∼z, then x ∼z for all x,y,z ∈P. If
x ∼y then x is a descendant of y, and if y ∼z then y is a descendant of z, so therefore x is
a descendant of z also and so x ∼z. Thus D is transitive.
We have seen that D is transitive but not reflexive or symmetric and so it is not an equivalence
relation.
What about the relation B? Is it reflexive? Is x ∼ x for all x ∈ P? Well, this is true since
every person x has an ancestor who is an ancestor of x. So B is reflexive.
Is B symmetric? We need to check that if x ∼ y then y ∼ x, for all x,y ∈ P. If x ∼ y
then x has an ancestor who is an ancestor of y, but then clearly y has an ancestor who is an
ancestor of x so y ∼x and B is symmetric.
Is B transitive? We need to check that if x ∼ y and y ∼ z, then x ∼ z for all x,y,z ∈ P.
If x has an ancestor who is an ancestor of y, y has an ancestor who is an ancestor of z it is
not always true that x has an ancestor who is an ancestor of z. For example, suppose y has
parents x and z. Then x ∼y and y ∼z but x and z do not have to have a common ancestor
so we are not guaranteed that x ∼z. We have shown that B is not transitive.
We have seen that B is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive, and so it is not an
equivalence relation.
What about the relation S? Is it reflexive? Is x ∼ x for all x ∈ P? Well, this is true since
every person x has the same parents as themselves. So S is reflexive.
Is S symmetric? We need to check that if x ∼y then y ∼x, for all x,y ∈P. If x ∼y then
x has the same parents as y, but then clearly y has the same parents as x so y ∼x and S is
symmetric.
Is S transitive? We need to check that if x ∼y and y ∼z, then x ∼z for all x,y,z ∈P. If
x has the same parents as y, and y has the same parents as z thenx has the same parents as
z. So S is transitive.
We have seen that S is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, and so it is an equivalence
relation.
Example 1.46. We can put a relation on Ras follows: x ∼y if x−y ∈Z. Note that under
this relation we have 1.1 ∼2.1, 1.1 ∼2.1, 1.1 ∼3.1 etc. and also 1.1 ∼−0.9, 1.1 ∼−1.9 ...
Is this an equivalence relation on R?
We need to check if ∼ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Reflexivity: Is x ∼x for all x ∈R? Yes, because x −x = 0 ∈Zfor all x ∈R.
Symmetry: If x ∼ y is y ∼ x for all x,y ∈ R? Yes, because x ∼ y means that x −y ∈ Zso
there exists n ∈Zsuch that x −y = n, but then y −x = −n ∈Zand so y ∼x.
Transitivity: If x ∼ y and y ∼ z is it true that x ∼ z? Yes, if x ∼ y then there exists
n ∈ Zsuch that x −y = n, and y ∼ z so there exists m ∈ Zsuch that y −z = m. Then
x −z = x −y + y −z = n + m ∈Zand so x ∼z.
Thus our relation ∼ is an equivalence relation on R.
Exercise 1.47. Let A be the set of all books in the Maynooth University Library. Define
an equivalence relation on A. Define a relation on A which is not an equivalence relation.
