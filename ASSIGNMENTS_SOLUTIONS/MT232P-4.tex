        Suppose Met Eirann provides the following predictions:\\
        (P1) There is a 60 percent chance that it will rain today.\\
        (P2) There is a 50 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow.

    \homBox{
        Let 'R' indicate a day with rain and 'N' a day with no rain. List an appro-
        priate sample space $\Omega$.

    \homBox{
        Let A be the event that it rains today and let B be the event that it rains
        tomorrow. List the outcomes of the following events:

        Find the probabilities for the following events:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It will rain today or tomorrow.

        Next you play a game for money. Each time heads comes up you win a Euro, each
time tails comes up you lose a Euro. However, as soon as you lose for the first time
you claim you have to go home and stop playing.
