        Let A be the event that it rains today and let B be the event that it rains
        tomorrow. List the outcomes of the following events:

        Find the probabilities for the following events:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It will rain today or tomorrow.
            \item It will rain today and tomorrow.
            \item It will rain today but not tomorrow.
            \item It will rain today or tomorrow, but not both days.

    }
    \solution
    "It will rain today or tomorrow." is the same as $A \cup B$,and therefore form part A: $$P(A \cup B) = P(RR) + P(RN) + P(NR) =$$$$= P(A)P(B) + P(A)P(B^c) + P(A^c)P(B) =$$$$= 0.6*0.5 + 0.6*0.5 + 0.4*0.5 = 0.8$$
    "It will rain today and tomorrow." is the same as $A \cap B$,and therefore form part A: $$P(A \cap B) = P(RR)=$$$$= P(A)P(B)=$$$$= 0.6*0.5 = 0.3$$
    "It will rain today but not tomorrow." is the same as $A \cap B^c$,and therefore form part A: $$P(A \cap B^c) = P(RN) =$$$$= P(A)P(B^c) =$$$$= 0.6*0.5 = 0.3$$
    "It will rain today or tomorrow, but not both days." has the following outcomes: RN, NR. Then The probability for that event (Let's call it C) will be: $$P(C) = P(RN) + P(NR) =$$$$= P(A)P(B^c) + P(A^c)P(B) =$$$$= 0.6*0.5 + 0.4*0.5 = 0.5$$

        I am twice as likely to be late on a rainy day, compared to dry days. I am late for
        work one quarter of all days.
