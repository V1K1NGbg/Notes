Proposition is a statement that is ether true or false,but not both

"3 is a prime number" - true
However the statement: "Where are you going?" is not a proposition

Remark 6:
    A proposition takes exactly one of the values: true or false.
    Typically, we denote true by T or 1 and we denote false by F or 0.
    The proposition above is called elementary proposition because they can't be broken into simpler propositions
    "6 > 5 and 110 is even"
    The proposition above is called compound proposition because they can be broken into simpler propositions

Remark 7:
    1. Negation (NOT)
        ¬

    2. Conjunction (AND)
        ∧

    3. Disjunction (OR)
        v

            T   F   F

    p   q   ¬q  p ∧ ¬q  ¬(p ∧ ¬q)
    T   T   F     F         T
    T   F   T     T         F
    F   T   F     F         T
    F   F   T     F         T

Example:
    Check that p ⇒ q is equivalent to ¬p v q

Remark 9:
    The "If and only if" statement is denoted by p ⇔ q and can be defined as:
        p ⇔ q = (p ⇒ q) ∧ (q ⇒ p)

Remark 10:
    Order of operation:
        ¬ -> ∧ -> v

Tautology:
    A formula is a tautology if it takes the value T for all possible values of its variables.

Example:
    p v ¬p is a tautology, because its truth table is:
        p   ¬p  p v ¬p
        T   F   T
        F   T   T

Example:
    (p ∧ q) ∧ r ∼ p ∧ (q ∧ r)

Proof:
    p   q   r   p ∧ q   (p ∧ q) ∧ r
    T   T   T   T       T
    T   T   F   T       F

Remark 11:
    One can solve that the following equivalences hold:
        Idempotency: p v p ∼ p, p ∧ p
        Associative: p v (q v r) ∼ (p v q) v r, p ∧ (q ∧ r) ∼ (p ∧ q) ∧ r
        Commutativity: p v q ∼ q v p
        Distributivity: p ∧ (q v r) ∼ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r), p v (q ∧ r) ∼ (p v q) ∧ (p v r)
        Identity: p v T ∼ T, p ∧ T ∼ p, p v F ∼ p, p ∧ F ∼ F
        Compliments: p v ¬p ∼ T, p ∧ ¬p ∼ F
        Involution: ¬(¬p) = p
        De Morgan's Laws: ¬(p v q) ∼ ¬p ∧ ¬q, ¬(p ∧ q) ∼ ¬p v ¬q

Remark 12:
    You can prove Remark 11 using truth tables.
    You can replace letters with formulas.
    You can replace sub-formulas with other formulas.
