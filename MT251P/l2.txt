Proposition is a statement that is ether true or false,but not both

"3 is a prime number" - true
However the statement: "Where are you going?" is not a proposition

Remark 6:
    A proposition takes exactly one of the values: true or false.
    Typically, we denote true by T or 1 and we denote false by F or 0.
    The proposition above is called elementary proposition because they can't be broken into simpler propositions
    "6 > 5 and 110 is even"
    The proposition above is called compound proposition because they can be broken into simpler propositions

Remark 7:
    1. Negation (NOT)
        (not sign)

    2. Conjunction (AND)
        (and sign /\)

    3. Disjunction (OR)
        (or sign \/) 

    Tables:
        1. Negation
            p   (not)p
            T   F
            F   T

        2. Conjunction
            p   q   p /\ q
            T   T   T
            T   F   F
            F   T   F
            F   F   F

        3. Disjunction
            p   q   p \/ q
            T   T   T
            T   F   T
            F   T   T
            F   F   F

Example:
    p   q   (not)q  p/\((not)q) (not)(p/\((not)q))
    T   T   F       F           T
    T   F   T       T           F
    F   T   F       F           T
    F   F   T       F           T
