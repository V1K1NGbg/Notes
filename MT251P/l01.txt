1 - Problem solving

1.1 Problem
    1. Understand the problem
    2. Draw a diagram (optional)
    3. Never say you can't solve a problem
    4. Try a different approach
    5. The more problems you solve -> the better you will get at solving them
    6. Learn from your mistakes

1.2 Proof
    Axioms: accepted statements not requiring prove
    Deductive reasoning: start with premises and we then derive conclusion
    Mathematical proof: requires deductive reasoning from axioms

Remark 3: 
    P ⇒ Q (If P therefor Q)
    P ⇔ Q (If and only if P therefor Q)

Proof that the √ af an odd number is odd:
    Proof 1:
        n  = (2 * k) + 1 (is always odd)
        n² = ((2 * k) + 1)²
        n² = (4 * k²) + (4 * k) + 1
        n² = (2 * ((2 * k²) + (2 * k))) + 1 (is also always odd)
    
    Proof 2:
        If n² is an integer, then n has to be odd, because otherwise n is even and so (by example (6)): 
            n² is even which is impossible.

Remark 5:
    Negative numbers -> n < 0
    Non-negative numbers -> n ≥ 0
    "Root 2" -> √2 (only the positive value)

Proof that √2 is irrational:
    Supposing (Accepting) that √2 is rational:
        √2 = (a / b) 
        2 = (a² / b²)
        2 * b² = a²
        a² -> even
        ⇒ a -> even
        a = 2 * e for some integer e
        (4 * e²) = (2 * b²)
        (2 * e²) = b²
        b² -> even
        ⇒ b -> even

n is odd ↔ n² is odd
