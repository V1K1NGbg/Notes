    Proposition 1.7:
        Suppose AB and CD are parallel lines and EF is a third line 
            that intersects AB at G and intersects CD at H

        Then |∠AGF| = |∠DHE|

        The angle ∠AGF and ∠DHE are called alternate angles

    Proof:
        We prove it by contradiction

        Suppose |∠AGF| ≠ |∠DHE|

        Then either |∠AGF| < |DHE| or |∠AGF| > |DHE|

        Case 1.:
            Suppose |∠AGF| < |DHE|

            Then |∠AGF| + |∠EHC| < |∠DHE| + |∠EHC| = π

            By P5, the lines AB and CD  meet on the side of A, which is false.

            So |∠AGF| < |DHE| is false

        Case 2.:
            Suppose |∠AGF| > |DHE|

            A similar approach as in case 1 will show that |∠AGF| > |∠DHE| is false

            So |∠AGF| = |∠DHE|

    Proposition 1.8:
        Suppose △ABC is a triangle

        Then |∠ABC| + |∠BCA| + |∠CAB| = π

    Proof:
        Draw a line DE through A that is parallel to BC

        Then:
            |∠DAB| + |∠CAB| + |∠EAC| = π
            
        Now:
            |∠DAB| = |∠ABC| and |∠EAC| = |∠BCA|

        So:
            |∠ABC| + |∠CAB| + |∠BCA| = π

2.5 - Areas

    Note the following result:
        Suppose △ABC is a triangle and let AE denote the perpendicular from A onto BC (or an extension of BC if necessary)

        Then the aria of △ABC is (1/2) * |BC| * |AE|

    Proposition 1.9:
        Consider a triangle △ABC

        Choose D on AB and choose E on AC such that DE is parallel to BC

        Then:
            |AD|/|DB| = |AE|/|EC|

    Definition 2:
        Two triangles △ABC and △DEF are called similar if:
            |∠ABC| = |∠DEF|, |∠BCA| = |∠EFD|, |∠CAB| = |∠FDE|

    Proposition 1.10:
        Suppose AB and CD are lines and EF is a third line that intersects AB at G and intersects CD at H.

        If |∠EGB| = |∠DHE| then AB and CD are parallel

    Proposition 1.11:
        Suppose △ABC and △DEF are similar triangles then:
            |DE|/|AB| = |EF|/|BC| = |DF|/|AC|

    Proposition 1.12: (Pythagorean's Theorem)
        Suppose △ABC is a right angled triangle with ∠ABC is a right angle

        Then |AB|² + |BC|² = |AC|²

    Proof:
        Draw a perpendicular from B onto AC at D.
        
        The triangles △ADB and △ABC are similar and so Proposition 1.11 gives:
            |AB|/|AD| = |AC|/|AB|

        Hence |AB|² = |AD| * |AC|

        △BDC and △ABC are similar and so:
            |DC|/|BC| = |BC|/|AC|

        Thus |BC|² = |DC| * |AC|

        So |AB|² + |BC|² = |AC| * (|AD| + |DC|) = |AC|²

3 - Vectors:
    
3.1 - Introduction:
    Remark 1:
        Vectors can be used to describe things that require both magnitude and direction

        For example you could say that you are sailing 30 mph in a south west direction.

        Here 30 is the magnitude and south west is the direction

        If a thing only requires a magnitude it can be described by a scaler (or constant)

        For example length is a scaler because it only requires a magnitude

        You can think of vector as being a path (in a particular direction) 
            between two points (called the terminal point)

        The vector v̱ starting at A and finishing at B is also denoted by:
            v̱ = v⃗ = AB⃗

        The magnitude of v̱ is the distance from A to B
