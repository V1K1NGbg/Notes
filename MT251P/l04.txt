    Proposition 1.7:
        Suppose AB and CD are parallel lines and EF is a third line 
            that intersects AB at G and intersects CD at H

        Then |∠AGF| = |∠DHE|

        The angle ∠AGF and ∠DHE are called alternate angles

    Proof:
        We prove it by contradiction

        Suppose |∠AGF| ≠ |∠DHE|

        Then either |∠AGF| < |DHE| or |∠AGF| > |DHE|

        Case 1.:
            Suppose |∠AGF| < |DHE|

            Then |∠AGF| + |∠EHC| < |∠DHE| + |∠EHC| = π

            By P5, the lines AB and CD  meet on the side of A, which is false.

            So |∠AGF| < |DHE| is false

        Case 2.:
            Suppose |∠AGF| > |DHE|

            A similar approach as in case 1 will show that |∠AGF| > |∠DHE| is false

            So |∠AGF| = |∠DHE|

    Proposition 1.8:
        Suppose △ABC is a triangle

        Then |∠ABC| + |∠BCA| + |∠CAB| = π

    Proof:
        Draw a line DE through A that is parallel to BC

        Then:
            |∠DAB| + |∠CAB| + |∠EAC| = π
            
        Now:
            |∠DAB| = |∠ABC| and |∠EAC| = |∠BCA|

        So:
            |∠ABC| + |∠CAB| + |∠BCA| = π

2.5 - Areas

    Note the following result:
        Suppose △ABC is a triangle and let AE denote the perpendicular from A onto BC (or an extension of BC if necessary)

        Then the aria of △ABC is (1/2) * |BC| * |AE|

    Proposition 1.9:
        Consider a triangle △ABC

        Choose D on AB and choose E on AC such that DE is parallel to BC

        Then:
            |AD|/|DB| = |AE|/|EC|

    Definition 2:
        Two triangles △ABC and △DEF are called similar if:
            |∠ABC| = |∠DEF|, |∠BCA| = |∠EFD|, |∠CAB| = |∠FDE|

    Proposition 1.10:
        Suppose AB and CD are lines and EF is a third line that intersects AB at G and intersects CD at H.

        If |∠EGB| = |∠DHE| then AB and CD are parallel

    Proposition 1.11:
        Suppose △ABC and △DEF are similar triangles then:
            |DE|/|AB| = |EF|/|BC| = |DF|/|AC|

    Proposition 1.12: (Pythagorean's Theorem)
        Suppose △ABC is a right angled triangle with ∠ABC is a right angle

        Then |AB|² + |BC|² = |AC|²

    Proof:
        Draw a perpendicular from B onto AC at D.
        
        The triangles △ADB and △ABC are similar and so Proposition 1.11 gives:
            |AB|/|AD| = |AC|/|AB|

        Hence |AB|² = |AD| * |AC|

        △BDC and △ABC are similar and so:
            |DC|/|BC| = |BC|/|AC|

        Thus |BC|² = |DC| * |AC|

        So |AB|² + |BC|² = |AC| * (|AD| + |DC|) = |AC|²

3 - Vectors:
    
3.1 - Introduction:
    Remark 1:
        Vectors can be used to describe things that require both magnitude and direction

        For example you could say that you are sailing 30 mph in a south west direction.

        Here 30 is the magnitude and south west is the direction

        If a thing only requires a magnitude it can be described by a scaler (or constant)

        For example length is a scaler because it only requires a magnitude

        You can think of vector as being a path (in a particular direction) 
            between two points (called the terminal point)

        The vector v̱ starting at A and finishing at B is also denoted by:
            v̱ = v⃗ = AB⃗

        The magnitude of v̱ is the distance from A to 
        
    Remark 2:
        Once we know the initial point A and the terminal point B of a vector v̱
            then we can think of v̱ in terms of the coordinates of A and B

    Example:
        Denote the usual two dimensional xy plane by:
            ℝ² = {(x, y) | x, y ∈ ℝ}

        and suppose:
            A = (x₁, y₁), B = (x₂, y₂) ∈ ℝ²

    Then the vector v̱ = AB⃗ cen be written in many ways including:
        v̱ = (x₂ - x₁, y₂ - y₁)

        v̱ = v₁ * i + v₂ * j where v₁ = x₂ - x₁, v₂ = y₂ - y₁

        v̱ is called the displacement vector
        
    Example:
        Suppose v̱ = AB⃗, where A = (2, 1), B = (4, -6)

        Then:
            v̱ = (4 - 2)i + (-6 + -1)j = 2i - 7j

    Remark 3:
        0i + 0j is called the zero vector

    Theorem 1:
        Suppose w̱ = w₁i + w₂j, v̱ = v₁i + v₂j and t ∈ ℝ

        Then:
            1. w̱ + v̱ = (w₁ + v₁)i + (w₂ + v₂)j
            2. tw̱ = tw₁i + tw₂j
            3. The magnitude (or length) of v̱ is denoted by ||v̱|| and satisfies:
                ||v̱|| = √(v₁² + v₂²)

            4. The dot (or scaler) product of w̱ and v̱ is denoted by w̱, v̱ and is defined by:
                w̱.v̱ = w₁v₁ + w₂v₂

            5. Suppose neither w̱ nor v̱ is the zero vector then:
                w̱.v̱ = ||w̱||||v̱||cos(θ) where θ is the angle between w̱ and v̱ and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π

    Example:
        Suppose E = (0, 0), F  = (2, -7) and w̱ = EF⃗

        Then w̱ = v̱ (from example) because w̱ = 2i - 7j

        This is an example of the fact that AB⃗ (from example) may equal EF⃗ even though A ≠ E and B ≠ F

        The reason that AB⃗ and EF⃗ are actually the same vector is because 
            AB⃗ and EF⃗ both have the same magnitude and direction

    Example
        Suppose w̱ = 2i - 3j, v̱ = 4i + 2j

        Then:
            w̱ + v̱ = 6i - j

            2v̱ = 8i + 4j

            ||w̱|| = √(4 + 9) = √13

            w̱.v̱ = 2 * 4 + (-3) * 2 = 2

    Definition:
        The non-zero vectors v̱, w̱ are said to be perpendicular (or orthogonal)
            if the angle between v̱ and w̱ is π/2

        We also define the zero vector to be perpendicular to any vector

    Remark 4:
        Two vectors v̱, w̱ in ℝ² are perpendicular ⇔ v̱.w̱ = 0

    Example:
        Suppose u̱ = 3i - 2j and w̱ = 4i + 6j

        Then find the angle between u̱ and w̱

        Solution:
            Note that u̱.w̱ = 0 and so u̱ and w̱ are perpendicular

            Hence the angle between u̱ and w̱ is π/2

        Remark 5:
            Suppose A = (0, 0), B = (x₁, x₂)

            Then the vector v̱ is AB⃗ is called a position vector

            So a position vector is a vector that has the origin (0, 0) as initial point
