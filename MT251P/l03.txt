2.1 Postulates and Common Notions

    Postulates:
        1. A unique straight line can be drawn between any two points
        2. A given finite straight line can be extended continuous in a straight line
        3. A point(it's center) and a distance(the length of the radius) define a circle
        4. All right angles are equal
        5. if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side
            less than two lines meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles

    Common Notions:
        1. Things which equal the same thing also equal each other
        2. If equals are added to equals, then the sums are equal
        3. If equals are subtracted from equals, then the remainders are equal
        4. Things which coincide with one another equal one another
        5. The whole is greater than the part

    Some notations and conventions:
        1. We denote two points by capital letters: A, B, C
        2. The line between two points A, B is denoted by AB and it's length is denoted by |AB|
        3. The angle formed by the two lines AB, AC at point A is denoted by ∠BAC or ∠CAB
        4. Angles are measured in radians and the magnitude of an angle ∠ABC is denoted by |∠ABC|
        5. Denote the triangle with △ABC
        6. Postulate 1 is denoted by P1
        7. Common notions 1 is denoted by CN1
        8. Propositions in Euclid's book are denoted by E.1.5 (Book 1, Propositions 5)

2.2 Fundamental Theorems in Euclidean Geometry

    Proof 1:
        Draw a circle O₁ with center A and radius |AB|(by P3)

        Draw a circle O₂ with center B and radius |AB|(by P3)

        Denote the point of intersection of the two circles by C.

        Then |AC| = |AB| and |BC| = |AB|.

        By CS1 we then have |AC| = |BC| = |AB| and so the triangle △ABC is na equilateral triangle and we are done.

    Definition 1:
        Two triangles △ABC, △DEF are called congruent if:
            |AB| = |DE|, |BC| = |EF|, |CA| = |FD| and
            |∠ABC| = |∠DEF|, |∠BCA| = |∠EFD|, |∠CAB| = |∠FDE|

    Remark 1:
        Propositions E.1.2 and E.1.3 show how we can construct a line at point A equal to a given line BC 
        and how we can cut from a longer line AB a section equals in length to a given shorter line CD

        Proposition E.1.4 states the following first method for proving congruence of a triangles

    Proposition 1.2 (SAS)
        Suppose we have two triangles △ABC, △DEF.

        If |AB| = |DE|, |BC| = |EF| and |∠ABC| = |∠DEF|, then △ABC is congruent to △DEF

    Remark 2:
        Euclid's proof os SAS uses "superposition"

        Nowadays, SAS a typically taken as an axiom and we will do that

        We will use two other congruence results

    Fact ASA:
        Suppose we have two triangles △ABC, △DEF

        If |∠ABC| = |∠DEF|, |BC| = |EF| and ||∠BCA| = |∠EFD| then △ABC is congruent to △DEF

    Fact SSS:
        Suppose we have two triangles △ABC, △DEF

        If |AB| = |DE|, |BC| = |EF| and |AC| = |DF| then △ABC is congruent to △DEF

    Proposition 1.3:
        Suppose we have an is isosceles triangle △ABC with |AB| = |AC| then |∠ABC| = |∠BCA|

    Proof:

        Choose F on AD and G on AE such that |AG| = |AF| (by Proposition E.1.3)

        Join F to C and join B to G

        Consider the triangle △ABG, △ACF

        We have |AC| = |AB|, |AF| = |AG|, |∠FAC| = |∠BAG| and so SAS implies that:
            △ABG is congruent to △ACF

        So |FC| = |BG|, |∠AFC| = |∠AGB|

        Hence |∠BFC| = |∠CGB| and |FC|

        Also since |AF| = |AG| and |AB| = |AC| then we get |BF| = |CG| (by CN3)

        So SAS implies that △BFC is congruent to △CGB then:
            |∠ABC| = |∠ABG| - |∠CBG| = |∠ACF| - |∠FCB| = |∠BCA|

    Proposition 1.4:
        Suppose △ABC is a triangle with |∠ABC| = |∠BCA|

        Then |AB| = |AC|

    Proof:
        We will prove this by contradiction.

        Suppose |AB| ≠ |AC|

        Then we either have |AB| > |AC| or |AB| < |AC|

        Case 1.:
            Suppose |AB| > |AC|

            Choose D on AB with |BD| = |AC|

            Join C to D and use SAS to get that △ABC is congruent to △DEF which contradicts CN5

            Hence |AB| > |AC| is false

        Case 2.:
            Suppose |AB| < |AC|

            Use a similar approach as in Case 1 to get that |AB < |AC| is false

        Overall then we have |AB| = |AC| and we are done

2.3 Some elementary constructions

    Proposition 1.5:
        To construct the bisector of a given angle ∠BAC

    Proof:
        Choose D on AB and E on AC with |AE| = |AD|

        Join D to E and construct the equilateral triangle △DEF on DE

        Join A to F

        By SSS we get that △ADF is congruent to △AEF and so |∠DAF| = |∠EAF|

        Hence AF bisects ∠DAE which equals ∠BAC and we are done

Section 2.4: (Angles and Parallels)
    Remark 3:
        We will use the following results:
            1. Suppose a line CD is a drawn from a point C on the line AB between A and B
                
                Then |∠ACD| + |∠DCB| = π

            2. Suppose C is a point not on a line AB

                Then there exists a unique line through C that is parallel to AB

    Remark 4:
        Result 2 in remark 3 above is equivalent to P5

        It is a simpler version of P5

    Proposition 1.6:
        Suppose the line AB and CD intersect at the point E. Then |∠AEC| = |∠BED|

        The angles ∠AEC and ∠BED are called opposite angles

    Proof:
        We have |∠AEC| + |∠CED| = π and |∠CEB| + |∠BED| = π

        By CN1 we then get |∠AEC| + |∠CEB| = |∠CEB| + |∠BED|

        Hence |∠AEC| = |∠BED|
