Chapter 2 (Sequences)

Defⁿ:
    A sequence is a function whose domain is ℕ

We usually denote sequences as:
    {aₙ}(n∈ℕ) or {aₙ}(n = 1)(∞) or {aₙ}

We want convergence

We want to define lim

arbitrarily close to a (or as close as we like to a)

Defⁿ:
    Let {aₙ} be a sequence of real numbers

    Let a ∈ ℝ

    We say {aₙ} converges to a
        or Lim(n → ∞) aₙ = a

        if ∀ɛ > 0 we can say that ∃N ∈ ℕ

        where |aₙ - a| < ɛ if n ≥ N
