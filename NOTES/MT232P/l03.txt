Equivalence Relations:
    A relation on A ‚àº is a subset of AxA

    We say x ‚àº y if (x, y) ‚àà ‚Ñï

    A = {1, 2, 3}

    ‚àº ‚àà AxA

    ‚àº = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)}

    1 ‚àº 1
    2 ‚àº 1
    1 ‚àº 3
    2 ‚àº 3 ??? 2 ~ 2

    But 1 ‚âÅ 2 here

    Def‚Åø:
         If A ia a non-empty set, we say a relation ‚àº is an equivalence relation on A if:
            1. x ‚àº x ‚àÄx ‚àà A (reflexivity)
            2. if x ‚àº y then y ‚àº x ‚àÄx, y ‚àà A (symmetry)
            3. If x ‚àº y and y ‚àº z then x ‚àº z ‚àÄx, y, z ‚àà A (transitivity)

    Example:
        Let A = {set of all books in MU Library}

        Find an equivalence relation on A

        If x and y are books:
            x ‚àº y if they have EXACTLY the same authors -> equivalence relation
            x ‚àº y if they have an author in common -> reflexivity + symmetry but not transitivity
            x ‚àº y if they have a common genre -> reflexivity + symmetry but not transitivity
            x ‚àº y if they are different editions of the same book -> symmetry + transitivity but not reflexivity

    Example:
        Let A = ‚Ñù

        x ‚àº y if x < y (transitivity but not reflexivity or symmetry)

    Example:
        Let A = ‚Ñù

        Define ‚àº on ‚Ñù by :
            x ‚àº y  if x - y ‚àà ‚Ñ§

        What numbers are related to 1.1

        1.1 ‚àº 2.1
        1.1 ‚àº m + 0.1, m ‚àà ‚Ñ§
        1.1 - (m + 0.1) = 1 - m ‚àà ‚Ñ§

        1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, ...

        -1 + 0.1 = -0.9, -1.9, -2.9, ...

        All related to 1.1

        Is this an equivalence relation?

        Check the three conditions:
            1. Is x ‚àº x  ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñù?
                x ‚àº x if x - x ‚àà ‚Ñ§ but x - x = 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ§

            2. If x ‚àº y is y ‚àº x?
                If x ‚àº y then
                    x - y ‚àà ‚Ñ§
                ie x - y = m for some m ‚àà ‚Ñ§
                    y - x = -(x - y) = -m ‚àà ‚Ñ§
                        since m ‚àà ‚Ñ§
                            so y ‚àº x

            3. If x ‚àº y and y ‚àº z is x ‚àº z?
                If x ‚àº y then ‚àÉn ‚àà ‚Ñ§ such that x - y = n

                If y ‚àº z then ‚àÉm ‚àà ‚Ñ§ such that y - z = m

                x - z = x - y + y - z = n + m ‚àà ‚Ñ§

            So our relation is an equivalence relation on ‚Ñù

    Def‚Åø:
        If ‚àº is an equivalence relation on A and if a ‚àà A we define the equivalence class of a to be:
            [a] = {x ‚àà A | x ‚àº a}

        In previous example:
            [1.1] = {x ‚àà ‚Ñù | x = 1.1 + m, m ‚àà ‚Ñ§}
                  = {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, ..., -0.9, -1.9, ...}

        Notice 3.1 ‚àº 4.1:
            3.1 - 4.1 = -1 ‚àà ‚Ñ§

        [Hamlet] = {all books written by William Shakespeare}

        Note:
            In an equivalence relation a ‚àº a, so a ‚àà [a] always
            ie [a] ‚â† ‚àÖ

    Thm 1.49:
        Let A be a set and ‚àº an equivalence relation on A

        If x, z ‚àà A
            then [x] = [z] if and only if x ‚àº z (‚áí and ‚áê)

    Proof:
        We need to prove:
            1. If x ‚àº z then [x] = [z]
            2. If [x] = [z] then x ‚àº z

        Proof of 1:
            Suppose x ‚àº z and prove [x] = [z]
            
            To prove [x] = [z] we need to show:
                [x] ‚àà [z] and [z] ‚àà [x]
                since [x] and [z] are sets

                    A. Try to show [x] ‚àà [z] if x ‚àºz
                        Let y ‚àà [x] and show y ‚àà [z]

                        We know x ‚àº z and y ‚àà [x]
                            so x ‚àº y

                        x ‚àº z means z ‚àº x by symmetry

                        We have z ‚àº x and x ‚àº y so z ‚àº y
                            so y ‚àà [z]

                        So if x ‚àº z then [x] ‚àà [z]

                    B. To show [z] ‚àà [x]:
                        Let w ‚àà [z] and show w ‚àà [x]
                            w ‚àà [z] so w ‚àº z and x ‚àº z or z ‚àº x

                        So w ‚àº z and z ‚àº x
                            ‚áí w ‚àº x by transitivity

                        So w ‚àà [x]

                        If x ‚àº z then [z] ‚àà [x]

                    Putting A. and B. together:
                        If x ‚àº z then [x] = [z]

                        So 1. is proved

        Proof of 2:
            Show if [x] = [z] then x ‚àº z
            
            If [x] = [z] then
                We know x ‚àà [x]
                    [x] = [z]

                So x ‚àà [z] ‚áí x ‚àº z by definition

    Equivalence relation:
        ~ relation on a set A withe the properties:
            1. x ~ x ‚àÄx ‚àà A (reflexivity)
            2. If x ~ y then y ~ x (symmetry)
            3. If x ~ y and y ~ z then x ~ z (transitivity)

        If ~ is an equivalence relation:
            [a] = {x ‚àà A | x ~ a}
            a ‚àà [a] so [a] ‚â† ‚àÖ

        Showed:
            [x] = [z] if and only if x ~ z

    Cor 1.50:
        Let A be a set and ~ an equivalence relation on A.

        Let x, z ‚àà A
            then either [x] = [z] or [x] ‚à© [z] ‚â† ‚àÖ

    Proof:
        Suppose [x] ‚à© [z] ‚â† ‚àÖ

        So ‚àÉy such that y ‚àà [x] ‚à© [z]

        So y ‚àà [x] and y = [z]
        ie y ~ x and y ~ z
        so x ~ y and y ~ z
        so x ~ z by transitivity
        ie [x] = [z]

    These equivalence classes cover all of A since each a ‚àà [a] with no overlaps

    Let E be the set of equivalence classes of ~

    E = {[a] | a ‚àà A}

    ‚ãÉa ‚àà A [a] = A
    and [a] ‚à© [b] = ‚àÖ
    if a ‚âÅ b

    Def‚Åø:
        A partition of a set A is a collection of disjoint subset of A
        whose union is all of A

        Our equivalence classes of ~ form a partition of A

    Example:
        Let A be the set of counties in Ireland

        Let:
            A‚ÇÅ = {counties in Munster}
            A‚ÇÇ = {counties in Leinster}
            A‚ÇÉ = {counties in Ulster}
            A‚ÇÑ = {counties in Connacht}

        A‚ÇÅ ‚à™ A‚ÇÇ ‚à™ A‚ÇÉ ‚à™ A‚ÇÑ = A
        and A·µ¢ ‚à© A‚±º = ‚àÖ if i ‚â† j

        {A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ, A‚ÇÉ, A‚ÇÑ} is a partition of A

        We saw that equivalence relations give us partitions

        Now we can see that given a partition of A
        we can define an equivalence relation on A
        which has equivalence classes exactly equal to the sets in our partition

        Let D = {A·µ¢} where A·µ¢ ‚à© A‚±º = ‚àÖ if i ‚â† j
        ie D is a partition of A 

        Put an equivalence on D such that the A·µ¢'s are the equiv classes

        Define x ~D y if x, y ‚àà A·µ¢ for some i is ~D an equiv relation on A?

        1. Is x ~D x?
            x ‚àà A = ‚à™A·µ¢ ‚áí x ‚àà A·µ¢ for some i

        2. If x ~D y, is y ~D x?
            x ~D y ‚áí ‚àÉ j such that x, y ‚àà A‚±º
            so y, x ‚àà A‚±º ‚áí y ~D x

        3. If x ~D y and y ~D z is x ~D z
            x ~D y ‚áí ‚àÉi such that x, y ‚àà A·µ¢
            y ~D z ‚áí ‚àÉj such that z, y ‚àà A‚±º
                y ‚àà A·µ¢ ‚à© A‚±º ‚áí i = j (otherwise A·µ¢ ‚à© A‚±º = ‚àÖ)

            ‚áí x ‚àà A·µ¢, z ‚àà A·µ¢
            ‚áí x ~D z

¬ß 1.4 - Cardinality
    Cardinality <-> size

    A = {a, b, c} <-> {cat, dog, mouse}

    {1, 2, 3, ..., n}
    <-> A bijection

    If A and B are finite sets, we can see that there is a bijection between them
    if and only if A and B have the same number of elements (Prove)

    Def‚Åø:
        Let x and y be two sets we say x is numerically equivalent to y(or has the same cardinality as y)
        ‚àÉf: x -> y which is a bijection

    Example:
        If A = {a, b, c}, B = {1, 2, 3}
            f: B -> A 

            f(1) = a
            f(2) = b
            f(3) = c

            is a bijection

    Example:
        A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = {counties in Munster}
            f: A -> B

            f(1) = Cork,
            f(2) = Clare,
            f(3) = Kerry,
            f(4) = Limerick,
            f(5) = Tipperary,
            f(6) = Waterford


            f is a bijection
                A, B are numerically equivalent

    Example:
        Let A = ‚Ñï, B = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}
            f: A -> B

            f(n) = 2n is a bijection

            So ‚Ñï and the even numbers are numerically equivalent or have same cardinality

    Example:
        Galileo noticed

            1 -> 1¬≤
            2 -> 2¬≤ = 4
            ...
            n -> n¬≤

            gives a bijection from ‚Ñï to the perfect squares

            So they have same cardinality

    Def‚Åø:
        We say a set A is finite if ‚àÉ a bijection

        f:{1, 2, 3, ..., n} -> A
        for some n ‚àà ‚Ñï

        Otherwise we say A is infinite

    Example:
        ‚Ñï and ‚Ñ§ are numerically equivalent

        f: ‚Ñï -> ‚Ñ§ a bijection

        f(n) = {n/2, if n is even,
                -((n-1)/2), if n is odd}

        If we have a bijection between ‚Ñï and a set A

        Let f(n) be denoted by a‚Çô

        A = {a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ, ...}

        We can list the elements

    Question:
        Can you do this for any set?

        Is ‚Ñö numerically equivalent to ‚Ñï?

        What about ‚Ñù?

    Example:
        We can find intervals in ‚Ñù which are numerically equivalent to ‚Ñù

        (-œÄ/2, œÄ/2) is numerically equivalent to ‚Ñù since:
            f(x) = tan(x)

        tan(x):
            (-œÄ/2, œÄ/2) -> ‚Ñù is a bijection

        We can also show that (-1, 1) is numerically equivalent to ‚Ñù

    x/(x¬≤ - 1)
        (-1, 1) has the same cardinality as ‚Ñù

    Def‚Åø:
        Let there be an equivalence relation ~

        Let S be the set of subsets of u

        We will define ~ on S

        If A, B ‚àà ùïä, we say A ~ B if A is numerically equivalent to B
            ie ‚àÉf: A -> B a bijection

        Check ~ is an equivalence relation on S

        1. Is A ~ A ‚àÄA ‚àà S:
            Yes
            
            Let f = id‚Çê

        2. If A ~ B, is B ~ A?
            Yes, if:
                f: A -> B is a bijection
                f‚Åª¬π: B -> C is also a bijection

        3. If A ~ B and B ~ C is A ~ C?
            A ~ B ‚áí ‚àÉf: A -> B a bijection
            B ~ C ‚áí ‚àÉg: B -> C

        Let h: A -> C be g‚Çíf: A -> C + we showed that this is also a bijection

        Think of:
            [‚Ñï] = {‚Ñï, ‚Ñ§, E, O, ...}
            [‚Ñù] = {‚Ñù, (-œÄ/2, œÄ/2), (-1, 1), ...}
        
        Where is ‚Ñö?
        
        Is [‚Ñï] ‚à© [‚Ñù] = ‚àÖ?

    Thm 1.59: (The Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem)
        If x and y are sets each of which is numerically equivalent to a subset of the other then:
            x is numerically equivalent to y

    Def‚Åø: 
        We say a set A is countably infinite if ‚àÉ a bijection from ‚Ñï to A

        We say a set is countable if it is either finite or countably infinite

        So ‚Ñ§, ‚Ñï, E etc are countably infinite

        We say a set is uncountable if it is not countable

    Thm 1.62:
        Every subset of a countable set is countable

    Proof:
        Let A be a countable set

        Let B ‚äÇ A

        If B is finite, then it is a countable

        So assume B is infinite

        We want to prove that it is countably infinite

        Since A s countably infinite we can write A as {a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ, ...}

        f: ‚Ñï -> B
        f(x) = a‚Çô‚Çñ
