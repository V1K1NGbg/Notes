P(A) = power set of A is the set of subsets of A

Thm: (Cantor's Theorem)
    If A is a set and P(A) is its power set then
        A is not numerically equivalent to P(A)

Example:
    ℝ and P(ℝ) are not numerically equivalent

    We have two uncountable sets which are not numerically equivalent to each other

Cardinal Numbers:
    - use these to denote the cardinality of a set:
        0, 1, 2, 3, ...
        are all cardinal Numbers

Cardinality of ∅ is 0
Cardinality of {a} is 1 etc.

Cardinality of ℕ is denoted by ℵ₀

ℵ₀ is the cardinality of any countably infinite set

Cardinality of ℝ is denoted by c (for continuum)

Cardinal numbers:
    0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ... < ℵ < c < 2ᶜ < ((2)²)ᶜ < ...

    2ᶜ - cardinality of P(ℝ)

    So we have infinitely many cardinalities of uncountable sets

Is there a set with cardinality bigger than ℵ₀ but smaller than c?

This is the Continuum Hypothesis

Gödel and Cohen (1940's) proved that this question is independent
    of our axioms of set theory (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory)

Can't prove or disprove the statement

Cardinality of P(ℕ) = c 

Prove???

§ 1.5 - Properties of ℝ (order on ℝ):

Defⁿ:
    An order relation on a set A is a relation with the following properties:
        1. For every x, y ∈ A then either x < y, x > y or x = y (comparability)
        2. For no x ∈ A does x < x hold (non-reflexivity)
        3. If x < y and y < z then x < z ∀x, y, z ∈ A (transitivity)

Example:
    If A = ℝ and < means the usual 'less than' then < is an order relation on ℝ

Example:
    If <A is an order relation  on A and <B is an order relation on B can we define an order on AxB?
        (a, b) < (a', b')

        (Bubble sort for words for example)

        Dictionary order on AxB

Let's consider from now on the usual order < on ℝ:
    Let A < ℝ

    We say b ∈ A is the largest element of A if x < b for all x ∈ A - {b}

    We say a ∈ A is the smallest element of A if a < x for all x ∈ A - {a}

    Clearly A has at most one largest element and at most one smallest element

    ℤ, ℚ

    ℝ does not have a largest element + does not have a smallest element

    ∅ doesn't have largest or smallest elements

    ℕ has a smallest element (ie 1) but no largest element

    [0, 1] 0 is the smallest element and 1 is the largest element

    (0, 1) has neither largest or smallest element

    A = {y | y = √(5 - x²)} = (0, √5)

    domain of f(x) = √5 - x

Defⁿ:
    A set A ⊆ ℝ is bounded above if b ∈ ℝ such that x ≤ b ∀ x ∈ A

    We say b is an upper bound for A

    Let A = [0, 1]

    Upper bound include:
        1, 2, 3, 4, π, e, ... [1, ∞) (set of bounds of A)

    Let B = (0, 1) bas upper bounds:
        1, 2, 3, 4, π, e, ...

Defⁿ:
    Let A ⊂ ℝ

    We say b is an upper bound for A if x ≤ b ∀x ∈ A

    If A has  an upper bound we say A is bounded above

    (0, ∞) is not bounded above:

    A = [0, 1]

    Upper bounds:
        any b ≥ 1 is an upper bounds for A

    1 seams to be a special upper bound for A

Defⁿ:
    If the set of upper bounds of A has a smallest element
        then we call this the least upper bound of A

    We write it as lub(A)

    Note:
        This is also called the supremum of A and written sup(A)

Example:
    If A = [0, 1] then lub(A) = 1

    In this lub(A) ∈ A

    Can we find a set of B such that lub(B) ∉ B?
    
    B = [0, 1)

    lub(B) = 1

    1 ∉ B
    
Defⁿ:
    Let A ⊂ ℝ

    We say A is bounded below if ∃a ∈ ℝ such that a ≤ x ∀ x ∈ A

    We say a is a lower bound of A

    [0, 1] has lower bounds:
        0, -1, -(1/2), -37524, ...

    Similarly (0, 1) has these lower bounds (-∞, 0) has no lower bound

Defⁿ:
    If The set of lower bounds of A has a greater element
        we call it the greatest lower bound of A and write is as glb(A)

    Note:
        glb(A) is also called the infimum of A and denoted inf(A)

Example:
    glb(A) could belong to A  eg glb([0, 1]) = 0 and 0 ∈ [0, 1]

    glb(A) might not belong to A eg glb((0, 1]) = 0 and 0 ∉ (0, 1]

    It is possible that glb(b(A)) does not exist eg A = ℝ a \ (-∞, 0) have no glb

    Let S = {x ∈ ℚ | x² < 2}

    Does this have a lub in ℚ?
    
    No (since intuitively lub(S) should be √2 and √2 ∉ ℚ)

The Axiom of Completion:
    Every subset of ℝ which is bounded above has a least upper bound in ℝ

    One consequence of this is:

Thm 1.84: (The Archimedean Property)
    If x ∈ ℝ, then there exists n ∈ ℕ such that x < n

Proof:
    If the property does not hold then ∃x ∈ ℝ such that x ≥ n ∀n ∈ ℕ
        ie ℕ is bounded above so by Axiom of Completion:
            u = lub(ℕ) exists

    If u =lub(ℕ) then u - 1 < u so u - 1 is not an upper bound of ℕ

    So ∃ m ∈ ℕ such that u - 1 < m ≤ u so u < m + 1 and if m ∈ ℕ, m + 1 ∈ ℕ
        but u is an upper bound for ℕ and we have found m + 1 ∈ ℕ which is bigger than u ⇒⇐

Thm 1.85: (The density of ℚ in ℝ)
    Let a, b ∈ ℝ and a < b

    Then ∃ r ∈ ℚ such that a < r < b

Proof:
    Without loss of generality we can assume 0 ≤ a < b

    We need to find m, n ∈ ℕ such that a < (m/n) < b

    Consider the number 1/(b - a) then by the Archimedean Property:
        ∃ n ∈ ℕ such that 1/(b - a) < n or 1\n < b - a or a < b - (1/n)

    Choose m to be smaller natural number bigger than na ie m - 1 ≤ na < m

    So a < m/n, m - 1 ≤ na + 1, m < n(b - (1/n)) + 1 since a < b - (1/n),
        m < nb - 1 + 1 = nb, m/n < b

    Thus a < m/n < b ie ∃r ∈ ℚ such that a < r < b

Exercise:
    Prove this thm if a, b ≤ a

Exercise:
    Prove if a, b ∈ ℚ with a < b then ∃r ∈ ℝ - ℚ such that a < r < b

Thm 1.87: (The Nested Intervals Property)
    For each n ∈ ℕ assume we have a closed interval:
        Iₙ = [aₙ, bₙ]

    Assume Iₙ ⊃ Iₙ₊₁ ∀n

    Then ⋂∞ₙ₌₁ Iₙ ≠ ∅

    Note:
        This thm is not true for intervals that are not closed:
            Iₙ = (0, (1/n))

        ⋂∞ₙ₌₁ Iₙ = ?

        If x ∈ ⋂ Iₙ then x ∈ (0, (1/n)) ∀n ∈ ℕ 0 < x < (1/n) x ∄ ie ⋂∞ₙ₌₁ Iₙ = ∅

    Proof of Theorem:
        Let A = {aₙ | n ∈ ℕ} be the set of Left-hand endpoints of the Iₙ intervals

        Then A is bounded above since aₙ ∈ Iₙ ⊂ I₁ = [a₁, b₁] ∀n
            ie aₙ ≤ b₁ ∀n ∈ ℕ

        So b₁ is an upper bound for A

        In fact each bₙ is an upper bound of A

        By the Axiom of Completion A has  a lub

        Call lub(A) = x

        Claim x ∈ [aₙ, bₙ] ∀n

        Clearly x ≥ aₙ ∀n since x is an upper bound of A

        And x ≤ bₙ ∀n since each bₙ is an upper bound of A and x is the least upper bound of A

        Now aₙ ≤ x ≤ bₙ ∀n ie x ∈ [aₙ, bₙ] ∀n x ∈ Iₙ ∀n

        So x ∈ ⋂∞ₙ₌₁ Iₙ

        Therefore ⋂∞ₙ₌₁ Iₙ ≠ ∅
