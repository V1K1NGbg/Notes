inverse of A

make the matrix A into RREF and simultaneously do the same role operations on Iₙ where A = n x n

Then A -> Iₙ
And  Iₙ -> A⁻¹

To check we need to multiply A⁻¹ by A

Theorem 4:
    Suppose A, B ∈ Mₙₓₙ(ℝ)
    Then:
        AB = Iₙ ⇔ BA = Iₙ

Remark 3:
    A consequence of theorem 4 is that if you want to check that C = A⁻¹,
        then you only need to check that AC = Iₙ and you don't need to check that CA = Iₙ

Definition 3:
    Suppose A is an n x n matrix

    The determinant of A is denoted by det(A) and is defined as follows:
        If A = (a₁₁) is a 1 x 1 matrix, then det(A) = a₁₁
        If A = (a₁₁ a₁₂
                a₂₁ a₂₂) is a 2 x 2 matrix, then det(A) = a₁₁a₂₂ - a₁₂a₂₁

        Now assume the determinant has been defined for all (n - 1) x (n - 1) matrix

        How do we find det



Theorem 5:
    To calculate det we can choose any row and any column

    det(A) = det(Aᵀ

    If upper triangular (aᵢⱼ = 0 where i > j) then det(A) = a₁₁a₂₂a₃₃...aₙₙ

    If lower triangular (aᵢⱼ = 0 where i < j) then det(A) = a₁₁a₂₂a₃₃...aₙₙ

    If B is a matrix obtained from A by multiplying one row of A be a scalar s, then det(B) = s * det(A)

    If B is a matrix obtained from A by swapping two rows of A then det(B) = - det(A)

    If two rows of A are identical, then det(A) = 0

    If A has a zero row, then det(A) = 0

    If B is the matrix obtained from A by adding s times one row of A to another row of A then det(B) = det(A)

    If B is a matrix obtained from A by multiplying one column of A be a scalar s, then det(B) = s * det(A)

    If B is a matrix obtained from A by swapping two columns of A then det(B) = - det(A)

    If two columns of A are identical, then det(A) = 0

    If A has a zero column, then det(A) = 0

    If B is the matrix obtained from A by adding s times one column of A to another column of A then det(B) = det(A)

    det(AB) = det(A)det(B)
