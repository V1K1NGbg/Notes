Lecture 16

the identity matrix is denoted Iₙ and is n x n where each entry equal to 0 except the diagonal entries which are equal to 1

Example:
    I₃ = (1 0 0)
         (0 1 0)
         (0 0 1)

Remark 8:
    If A is any k x n matrix, then IₖA = A, AIₙ = a

Chapter 5 The inverse and determinant of a matrix

AB = Iₙ = BA , where A, B ∈ Mₙₓₙ(ℝ)

The operations to take you from A to Iₙ
are the same as the one that take you from Iₙ to a⁻¹
