Statistical experiment
All possible outcomes are denoted by Ω
Event is a subset of Ω
Events of Interest denoted by ɛ
Probability
    AP1: P(Ω) = 1
    AP2: If A ∈ ɛ then P(A) ≥ 0
    AP3: If A and B are disjoined events in ɛ then P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)


four letter and three digit password

    N = 26³ * 10⁴ = 175 760 000

a hacker can check 10⁷ passwords a day

what is the chance that the hacker guesses the password on the first day

10⁷/N = 10³/26³ = 0.0569

9 Combinatorics

sample k out of n elements

order either matters or it doesn't 

each sample is either replaced or its not replaced

Example:
    How many different functions:
        f: {1, 2, ..., 50} -> {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} are there?
        k ∈
