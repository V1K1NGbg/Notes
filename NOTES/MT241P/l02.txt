2. Principle of Induction
    Theorem 2:1 (Principle of Induction)
        Let n₀ ∈ ℤ and let P(n) be a property which is true or false for all n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n

        Let P(n₀) be true and and assume that if P(n) is true for some n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n
        then P(n + 1) is true

        Then P(n) is true for all integers n with n₀ ≤ n

    Proof:
        Set K := {n ∈ ℕ₀, P(n₀ + n) is true}

        As P(n₀) is true we have 0 ∈ K

        Furthermore if n ∈ K, then P(n₀ + n) is true and so by assumption

        P(n₀ + n + 1) is true consequently.

        S(n) = S(n + 0) = n + S(0) = n + 1 ∈ K

        So, by the axioms of induction K = ℕ₀

    Example 2.2:
        Show that:
            ∑ⁿ₁₌₁ i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (n * (n + 1))/2
        for all integers n ≥ 1

        The statement is true for the base case n = 1, as then ∑ⁿ₁₌₁ i = 1
        and (n * (n + 1))/2 = (1*2)/2 = 1

        Next suppose the statement is true for some integers n ≥ 1 we show it holds for n + 1.

        We have:
            ∑ⁿ⁺¹₁₌₁ i = (n + 1) + ∑ⁿ₁₌₁ i = (n + 1) + (n * (n + 1))/2 = (n + 1) * (1 + (n / 2)) =
            = (n + 1) * ((n + 2)/2) = ((n + 1)(n + 2))/2

        Hence the statement is true for n = 1

        In particular the statement is true for all n ≥ 1

    For n, k ∈ ℕ₀ such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n we define the binomial coefficient:
        (ⁿₖ) = (n!)/(k! * (n - k)!), when n! = {1 | if n = 0,
                                                Πⁿ₁₌₁ | if n ≥ 1}
    
    We claim that all binomial coefficients are integers.

    Check that (ⁿₖ) = 1, if n = 0 or k = 0.

    Hence we assume that neither is zero

    If n = 1, then k = 1 and (¹₁) = 1

    Hence the statement is true for n = 1

    Next assume the statement is true for some integers n ≥ 1 and all integers k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n

    Then for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n we have:
        (ⁿ⁺¹ₖ) = ((n + 1)!)/(k! * (n + 1 - k)!) = (n! * ((n + 1) - k + k))/(k! * (n + 1 - k)!) =
        = (n! * (n + 1 - k))/(k! * (n + 1 - k)!) + (n! * k)/(k! * (n + 1 - k)!) =
        = (n!)/(k! * (n - k)!) + (n)/((k - 1)! * (n - (k - 1))!) = (ⁿₖ) + (ⁿₖ₋₁)

    Both (ⁿₖ) and (ⁿₖ₋₁) are integers by assumption and thus (ⁿ⁺¹ₖ) is an integer

    Finally note that (ⁿ⁺¹ₙ₊₁) = 1

    Hence by induction (ⁿₖ) is an integer for all integers n ≥ 0 and all integers k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n

    Corollary 2.3 (Strong induction)
        Let  n₀ ∈ ℤ and let P(n) be a property which is true or false, for all n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n

        Let P(n₀) be true and assume that P(n + 1) is true for some n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n
        whenever P(k) is true for all integers k n₀ ≤ k ≤ n

        Then P(n) is true for all integers n with n₀ ≤ n

    Proof:
        We use induction.
        
        The base case holds, as P(n₀) is true.

        Next let P(n) is be true, for some n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n

        Assume there is some k₀ ∈ {n₀, ..., n} such that P(k₀) is false and choose the smallest such k₀

        Note that k₀ > n₀.

        Then P(k) is true, for all k ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ k ≤ k₀-1
        and so by assumption P(k₀) is true.

        Thus is a contradiction, ie k₀ as above does not exist. 
        
        So P(k) is true, for all k ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ k ≤ n and so by assumption P(n+1) is true

        Hence by Theorem 2.1, P(n) is true, for all n ∈ ℤ with n₀ ≤ n.
    
    Example:
        Set T₁ = 1, T₂ = 3 and recursively Tₙ = Tₙ₋₁ + Tₙ₋₂, for integers n ≥ 3 (Lucas sequence)

        Prove that:
            Tₙ < (7/4)ⁿ for all n ≥ 1

            As T₁ = 1 < 7/4 and T₂ = 3 < 49/16 = (7/4)² the statement holds for n ∈ {1, 2}

            Next suppose it holds for all k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, for some integer n ≥ 2

            Then:
                Tₙ₊₁ = Tₙ + Tₙ₋₁ < (7/4)ⁿ + (7/4)ⁿ⁻¹ = (7/4)ⁿ⁻¹ * ((7/4)+1) =
                = (7/4)ⁿ⁻¹ * (11/4) < (7/4)ⁿ⁻¹ * (7/4)² = (7/4)ⁿ⁺¹
                since (11/4) = (44/16) < (49/16) = (7/4)²

            Hence the statement holds for all integers n ≥ 1

    Theorem 2.5 (Well-Ordering Principle):
        Let S be a non-empty subset of ℕ₀. 
        
        Then S has a minimal element, that is, there is some l ∈ S so that l ≤ s, for all s ∈ S

    Proof:
        Let s be a subset of ℕ₀ without a minimal element.

        Then surely 0 ∉ S.

        Now set K:= {n ∈ ℕ₀ | n ∉ S}

        We say P(n) is true for some n ∈ ℕ₀, if n ∈ K

        Hence P(0) is true.

        Next let n ≥ 0 and assume that P(k) is true, for all k ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., n}

        Hence k ∉ S for all k ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., n}

        Then n + 1 ∉ S, as otherwise n + 1 is a minimal element of S, in contradiction to the above assumption.

        Hence n + 1 ∈ K, ie P(n + 1) is true.

        Now by Corollary 2.3 we get that K = ℕ₀

        In particular S = ∅

    Corollary 2.6:
        There is no a ∈ ℤ such that 0 < a < 1

    Proof:
        Assume there is such an integer a ∈ ℤ and let S be the set of all such a.

        Then S is non-empty subset of ℕ₀ and as such contains a minimal element l

        Note l ≠ 0.
        
        As l < 1, there is some x ∈ ℕ such that l + x = 1.

        Multiplying l onto this equation gives l² + x * l = l

        Clearly, x * l ∈ ℤ and so l² < l

        We also have 0 < l² < 1 that as l² ∈ S

        But this contradicts the minimality of l

        In particular there is no a as described

    Remark 2.7:
        The integers do not satisfy the Will-Ordering Principle
        as there are subsets of ℤ that do not contain a minimum element

        Take for instance ℤ or the negative integers

        In particular any number system contains the integers
        such as Q for instance, cannot satisfy the Well-Ordering Principle either
