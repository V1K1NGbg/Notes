4. Greatest Common Divisor

Defⁿ:
    For a, b ∈ ℤ not both zero we call d ∈ ℤ their greatest common divisor and write:
        d = gcd(a, b) if:
            1. d > 0
            2. d | a and d | b
            3. if c ∈ ℤ is such that c | a and c | b, c ≤ d

    We say that a, b are coprime, if gcd(a, b) = 1

Lemma 4.2:
    Let a, b ∈ ℤ such that a ≠ 0 and a | b

    Then gcd(a, b) = |a|

Proof:
    Clearly, |a| > 0

    Also we have that |a| divides both a and b

    Furthermore, if c ∈ ℤ is such that c | a and c | b, then by Lemma 3.4(5) we get that c ≤ |a|

    Therefore gcd(a, b) = |a|

Theorem 4.3:
    Let a, b ∈ ℤ, not both zero

    Then gcd(a, b) exists and is the minimal element in the set:
        S := {s * a + t * b | s, t ∈ ℤ, s * a + t * b > 0}

Proof:
    Note that |a| ∈ S or |b| ∈ S and so S is a non-empty set of natural numbers

    Then S has a minimal element:
        d = s * a + t * b > 0 for some s, t ∈ ℤ

    Next we show that d|a

    Assume it does not

    By the Division Algorithm there are q, r ∈ ℤ such that a = q * d + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ d 

    As d ∤ a  we have r > 0

    Now r = a - q * d = a - q * (s * a + t * b) = (1 - q * s) * a + (-q * t) * b

    Hence r ∈ S and r < d, which contradicts the minimality of d

    Hence d | a likewise one show d | b

    Finally let c ∈ ℤ such that c | a and c | b

    If c ≤ 0 then surely c ≤ d

    Hence assume c > 0

    By Lemma 3.4(7) we get c | d that is c * m = d for some m ∈ ℤ

    By Lemma 3.1 we have m > 0, as otherwise d ≤ 0 

    Hence d = c * (1 + (m - 1)) = c + c * (m - 1)

    Now either m - 1 = 0 in which case d = c or m - 1 > 0 in which case c < d

    So in all case we have that c ≤ d

    Overall we conclude that d = gcd(a, b)

Corollary 4.4:
    Let a, b ∈ ℤ not both zero

    Then:
        1. a and b are coprime if and only if there are s, t ∈ ℤ such s * a + t * b = 1
        2. If d = gcd(a, b),then gcd(a/b, b/d) = 1

Corollary 4.5: (Euclid's Lemma)
    Suppose that a, b are coprime integers and that a | b * c for some c ∈ ℤ

    Then a | c

Proof:
    Homework???

Example:
    Note that -2 | 16 = -2 * -8

    Hence by Lemma 4.2, we have that gcd (-2, 16) = |-2| = 2

Example:
    We have 3 * 17 + (-5) * 10 = 1

    Hence 17 and 10 are coprime ie gcd(17, 10) = 1

    Furthermore 3 * 34 + (-5) * 20 = 2 and as 2 | 34 and 2 | 20 we must have gcd(34, 20) - 2

Theorem 4.7: (The Euclidean Algorithm)
    Let a, b ∈ ℤ, not both zero and b ∤ a

    Set r₋₁ := a and r₀ = b and apply the Division Algorithm successively to rₖ₊₁ where:
        0 ≤ rₖ₊₁ < |rₖ| until rₙ₊₁ = 0 for some n ≥ 0

    That means we have:
        r₋₁ = q₀ * r₀ + r₁, where 0 < r₁ < |r₀|
        r₀  = q₁ * r₁ + r₂, where 0 < r₂ < |r₁|
        r₁  = q₂ * r₂ + r₃, where 0 < r₃ < |r₂|
        ...   ...  ...  ...       ... ...  ...
        rₙ₋₂ = qₙ₋₁ * rₙ₋₁ + rₙ, where 0 < rₙ < |rₙ₋₁|
        rₙ₋₁ = qₙ * rₙ

    Then gcd(a, b) = rₙ

Proof:
    As the sequence (rₖ)ₖ≥₁ is positive and decreasing the above process terminates

    In particular rₙ exists and rₙ > 0, by con
