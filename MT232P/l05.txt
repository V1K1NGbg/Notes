P(A) = power set of A is the set of subsets of A

Thm: (Cantor's Theorem)
    If A is a set and P(A) is its power set then
        A is not numerically equivalent to P(A)

Example:
    ℝ and P(ℝ) are not numerically equivalent

    We have two uncountable sets which are not numerically equivalent to each other

Cardinal Numbers:
    - use these to denote the cardinality of a set:
        0, 1, 2, 3, ...
        are all cardinal Numbers

Cardinality of ∅ is 0
Cardinality of {a} is 1 etc.

Cardinality of ℕ is denoted by ℵ₀

ℵ₀ is the cardinality of any countably infinite set

Cardinality of ℝ is denoted by c (for continuum)

Cardinal numbers:
    0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ... < ℵ < c < 2ᶜ < ((2)²)ᶜ < ...

    2ᶜ - cardinality of P(ℝ)

    So we have infinitely many cardinalities of uncountable sets

Is there a set with cardinality bigger than ℵ₀ but smaller than c?

This is the Continuum Hypothesis

Gödel and Cohen (1940's) proved that this question is independent
    of our axioms of set theory (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory)

Can't prove or disprove the statement

Cardinality of P(ℕ) = c 

Prove???

§ 1.5 - Properties of ℝ order on ℝ:

Defⁿ:
    An order relation on a set A is a relation with the following properties:
        1. For every x, y ∈ A then either x < y, x > y or x = y (comparability)
        2. For no x ∈ A does x < x hold (non-reflexivity)
        3. If x < y and y < z then x < z ∀x, y, z ∈ A (transitivity)

Example:
    If A = ℝ and < means the usual 'less than' then < is an order relation on ℝ

Example:
    If <A is an order relation  on A and <B is an order relation on B can we define an order on AxB?
        (a, b) < (a', b')

        (Bubble sort for words for example)

        Dictionary order on AxB

Let's consider from now on the usual order < on ℝ:
    Let A < ℝ

    We say b ∈ A is the largest element of A if x < b for all x ∈ A - {b}

    We say a ∈ A is the smallest element of A if a < x for all x ∈ A - {a}

    Clearly A has at most one largest element and at most one smallest element

    ℤ, ℚ

    ℝ does not have a largest element + does not have a smallest element

    ∅ doesn't have largest or smallest elements

    ℕ has a smallest element (ie 1) but no largest element

    [0, 1] 0 is the smallest element and 1 is the largest element

    (0, 1) has neither largest or smallest element

    A = {y | y = √(5 - x²)} = (0, √5)

    domain of f(x) = √5 - x

Defⁿ:
    A set A ⊆ ℝ is bounded above if b ∈ ℝ such that x ≤ b ∀ x ∈ A

    We say b is an upper bound for A

    Let A = [0, 1]

    Upper bound include:
        1, 2, 3, 4, π, e, ... [1, ∞) (set of bounds of A)

    Let B = (0, 1) bas upper bounds:
        1, 2, 3, 4, π, e, ...
