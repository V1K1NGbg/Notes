We proved that ℚ is countable and ℝ is uncountable

Example:
    Any interval (a, b) is numerically equivalent to to (0, 1)

    So (a, b) ~ (0, 1), (0, 1) ~ (-1, 1), (-1, 1) ~ ℝ

    So any interval (a, b) is numerically equivalent to ℝ (0, (1/n)) is numerically equivalent to ℝ

Thm 1.67:
    Any subset of ℝ which contains an open interval is numerically equivalent ro ℝ

Proof:
    Let x ∈ ℝ and (a, b) ⊂ x.

    So (a, b) ⊂ x ⊂ ℝ

    Well x is numerically equivalent to a subset of ℝ (namely to x itself)

    Also ℝ is numerically equivalent to a subset of x (namely (a, b))

    So by Schröder–Bernstein theorem, x is numerically equivalent to ℝ

Thm 1.68:
    Let S be the set of sequences of 0's and 1's

    S = {(a₁, a₂, a₃, ...) | aᵢ = {0, 1}}

    Then S is uncountable

Proof:
    Let f: ℕ -> S

    We will show that f could not be onto and thus cannot be bijection

    Let's denote f(n) = (xₙ₁, xₙ₂, xₙ₃, ...) where each xₙₖ is either 0 or 1:
        f(1) = x₁₁, x₁₂, x₁₃, ...
        f(2) = x₂₁, x₂₂, x₂₃, ...
        f(3) = x₃₁, x₃₂, x₃₃, ...
        ...    ...  ...  ...
        f(n) = xₙ₁, xₙ₂, xₙ₃, ...

    We will contradict a sequence in S which is not on this list

    Define y = (y₁, y₂, y₃, ...) where yₖ = {0 if xₖₖ = 1,
                                             1 if xₖₖ = 0}

    So yₖ ≠ xₖₖ ie the kᵗʰ element if the sequence y is different from the kᵗʰ element
        ie y ≠ f(k) ∀k ∈ ℕ

    So f: ℕ -> S is not onto

Exercise:
    Prove:
        1. ℕ x ℕ is countable
        2. ℝ x ℝ = ℝ² is uncountable
        3. The set of continuous functions from ℝ to ℝ is uncountable

(a, b) <-> {(x, y) | a < x < b, y = 0} or {(x, 0) | a < x < b}

Question:
    Are all uncountable sets numerically equivalent to each other?
    
    No

    We will show this using power sets

Defⁿ:
    Let A be a set then the power set of A is the set of subsets of A

    We write it as P(A)

Example:
    A = {a, b, c}

    P(A) = {{a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, ∅, {abc}}

    P(A) has 2³ elements

    In general if A is finite and A has n elements then P(A) has 2ⁿ elements

    If A is finite then A is not numerically equivalent to P(A)

Thm 1.73: (Cantor's Theorem)
    Given a set A there does not exist an onto function from A to P(A)

Proof:
    Let g: A -> P(A) be a function

    For each a ∈ A, g(a) is a subset of A

    This subset either contains A or it doesn't

    Let B be the subset of A consisting of elements of A which are not in their own image under g

    B = {a ∈ A | a ∉ g(a)}

    Clearly B ⊂ A so B ∈ P(A)

    We claim B is not in the image of g (ie g is not onto)

    Suppose B is in the image of g (ie B is an output of g or in the range of g)

    So B = g(a₀) for some a₀ ∈ A

    Is a₀ ∈ B or not?

    Case 1:
        Suppose a₀ ∈ B:
            B = {a ∈ A | a ∉ g(a)} so if a₀ ∉ g(a₀) but B = g(a₀) so a₀ ∉ B

    Case 2:
        Suppose a₀ ∉ B if a₀ ∉
