Thm 1.62:
    A subset of any countable set is countable

Proof:
    Suppose A is countable and B ⊂ A

    If B is finite we are done
    ⇒ assume B is infinite need f: ℕ -> B which is a bijection

    We know A is countable
    ⇒ we can list the elements of A = {a₁, a₂, a₃, ...}

    Let n₁ be the smallest positive integer of aₙ ∈ B

    Let n₂ be the smallest integer which is greater than n₁ with aₙ₂ ∈ B

    Carry on like this so nₖ is the smallest integer bigger than nₖ₋₁ such that
    aₙₖ ∈ B

    Define:
        f: ℕ -> B
        f(k) = aₙₖ

    Check this is 1-1 and onto so B is countably infinite

We can use the theorem to show that:
    1. B is countable by showing B ⊂ A
        where A is countable

    2. A is uncountable by showing B ⊂ A
        and B is uncountable

Notation:
    Let A be a set and for each α ∈ A suppose we have a set Eₓ

    Define ⋃(α∈A) Eₓ = {x | x ∈ Eₓ ∃α ∈ A}

Thm 1.63:
    Let {Eₙ}n∈ℕ be a collection of countable sets.

    Then S = ⋃(n∈ℕ)Eₙ is also countable

Proof:
    Since Eₙ is countable we can write Eₙ = {xₙ₁, xₙ₂, xₙ₃, ...}

    x₁₁, x₁₂, ...
    x₂₁, x₂₂, ...
    ..., ..., ...

    This array contains         Since A s countably inall elements of S by sweeping diagonally through the array

    Is it possible that some of the elements appear on this list more than once
        (if an element belongs to two different Eₙ and Eₘ then it will appear twice on list)

    But there is a subset T < ℕ which is numerically equivalent to S since ℕ is countable

    Our last theorem tells us that T is countable.

    So S is numerically equivalent  to a countable set ⇒ S is countable

Corollary 1.64:
    Let A be a countable set and suppose ∀α in A ∃ a set Bα

    Then  ⋃(α∈A) Bₓ is countable

Proof:
    Exercise???

Thm 1.65:
    ℚ is a countable set

Proof:
    Let Aₖ = {0/k, 1/k, -1/k, 2/k, -2/k, 3/k, -3/k} for k ∈ ℕ

    Clear each Aₖ is countable since:
        fₖ: ℤ -> aₙ
        fₖ(n) = n/k is 1-1 and onto

    ℚ = ⋃(k∈ℕ) Aₖ

    So ℚ is a countable union of countable sets ⇒ ℚ is countable

Thm 1.66:
    ℝ is uncountable

Proof:
    We will prove (0, 1) is uncountable

    Then since (0, 1) ⊂ ℝ we see that ℝ is uncountable (By Thm 1.62)

    We need to prove that there is no bijection from ℕ to (0, 1)

    We will assume that there is a bijection:
        f: ℕ -> (0, 1) and find a contradiction

    If x ∈ (0, 1) then it has a decimal expansion x = 0 . x₁, x₂, x₃, ...

    Where xᵢ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

    Suppose f: ℕ -> (0, 1) is a bijection

    We can list the images of ℕ as follows

    f(1) = 0 . a₁₁, a₁₂, a₁₃, ...
    f(2) = 0 . a₂₁, a₂₂, a₂₃, ...
    f(3) = 0 . a₃₁, a₃₂, a₃₃, ...
    ...        ...  ...  ...

    ie aₙₖ is the k-th digit after the decimal point in f(k)

    We will find b ∈ (0, 1) such that f(k) ≠ b ∀k ∈ ℕ

    Let b = 0 . b₁, b₂, b₃, ...
        where bₖ = {2 if aₖₖ ≠ 2,
                    3 if aₖₖ = 2}

        b ∈ (0, 1) and b ≠ f(k) since bₖ ≠ aₖₖ so b and f(k) differ in the k-th digit

    So f is not onto -><- (contradiction)

    So ∄ f: ℕ -> (0, 1) a bijection
    ⇒ (0, 1) is uncountable

We proved that ℚ is countable and ℝ is uncountable

Example:
    Any interval (a, b) is numerically equivalent to to (0, 1)

    So (a, b) ~ (0, 1), (0, 1) ~ (-1, 1), (-1, 1) ~ ℝ

    So any interval (a, b) is numerically equivalent to ℝ (0, (1/n)) is numerically equivalent to ℝ

Thm 1.67:
    Any subset of ℝ which contains an open interval is numerically equivalent ro ℝ

Proof:
    Let x ∈ ℝ and (a, b) ⊂ x.

    So (a, b) ⊂ x ⊂ ℝ

    Well x is numerically equivalent to a subset of ℝ (namely to x itself)

    Also ℝ is numerically equivalent to a subset of x (namely (a, b))

    So by Schröder–Bernstein theorem, x is numerically equivalent to ℝ

Thm 1.68:
    Let S be the set of sequences of 0's and 1's

    S = {(a₁, a₂, a₃, ...) | aᵢ = {0, 1}}

    Then S is uncountable

Proof:
    Let f: ℕ -> S

    We will show that f could not be onto and thus cannot be bijection

    Let's denote f(n) = (xₙ₁, xₙ₂, xₙ₃, ...) where each xₙₖ is either 0 or 1:
        f(1) = x₁₁, x₁₂, x₁₃, ...
        f(2) = x₂₁, x₂₂, x₂₃, ...
        f(3) = x₃₁, x₃₂, x₃₃, ...
        ...    ...  ...  ...
        f(n) = xₙ₁, xₙ₂, xₙ₃, ...

    We will contradict a sequence in S which is not on this list

    Define y = (y₁, y₂, y₃, ...) where yₖ = {0 if xₖₖ = 1,
                                             1 if xₖₖ = 0}

    So yₖ ≠ xₖₖ ie the kᵗʰ element if the sequence y is different from the kᵗʰ element
        ie y ≠ f(k) ∀k ∈ ℕ

    So f: ℕ -> S is not onto

Exercise:
    Prove:
        1. ℕ x ℕ is countable
        2. ℝ x ℝ = ℝ² is uncountable
        3. The set of continuous functions from ℝ to ℝ is uncountable

(a, b) <-> {(x, y) | a < x < b, y = 0} or {(x, 0) | a < x < b}

Question:
    Are all uncountable sets numerically equivalent to each other?
    
    No

    We will show this using power sets

Defⁿ:
    Let A be a set then the power set of A is the set of subsets of A

    We write it as P(A)

Example:
    A = {a, b, c}

    P(A) = {{a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, ∅, {abc}}

    P(A) has 2³ elements

    In general if A is finite and A has n elements then P(A) has 2ⁿ elements

    If A is finite then A is not numerically equivalent to P(A)

Thm 1.73: (Cantor's Theorem)
    Given a set A there does not exist an onto function from A to P(A)

Proof:
    Let g: A -> P(A) be a function

    For each a ∈ A, g(a) is a subset of A

    This subset either contains A or it doesn't

    Let B be the subset of A consisting of elements of A which are not in their own image under g

    B = {a ∈ A | a ∉ g(a)}

    Clearly B ⊂ A so B ∈ P(A)

    We claim B is not in the image of g (ie g is not onto)

    Suppose B is in the image of g (ie B is an output of g or in the range of g)

    So B = g(a₀) for some a₀ ∈ A

    Is a₀ ∈ B or not?

    Case 1:
        Suppose a₀ ∈ B:
            B = {a ∈ A | a ∉ g(a)} so if a₀ ∉ g(a₀) but B = g(a₀) so a₀ ∉ B

    Case 2:
        Suppose a₀ ∉ B if a₀ ∉
