Equivalence Relations:
    A relation on A ∼ is a subset of AxA

    We say x ∼ y if (x, y) ∈ ℕ

    A = {1, 2, 3}

    ∼ ∈ AxA

    ∼ = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)}

    1 ∼ 1
    2 ∼ 1
    1 ∼ 3
    2 ∼ 3

    But 1 ≁ 2 here

    Defⁿ:
         If A ia a non-empty set, we say a relation ∼ is an equivalence relation on A if:
            1. x ∼ x ∀x ∈ A (reflexivity)
            2. if x ∼ y then y ∼ x ∀x, y ∈ A (symmetry)
            3. If x ∼ y and y ∼ z then x ∼ z ∀x, y, z ∈ A (transitivity)

    Example:
        Let A = {set of all books in MU Library}

        Find an equivalence relation on A

        If x and y are books:
            x ∼ y if they have EXACTLY the same authors -> equivalence relation
            x ∼ y if they have an author in common -> reflexivity + symmetry but not transitivity
            x ∼ y if they have a common genre -> reflexivity + symmetry but not transitivity
            x ∼ y if they are different editions of the same book -> symmetry + transitivity but not reflexivity

    Example:
        Let A = ℝ

        x ∼ y if x < y (transitivity but not reflexivity or symmetry)

    Example:
        Let A = ℝ

        Define ∼ on ℝ by :
            x ∼ y  if x - y ∈ ℤ

        What numbers are related to 1.1

        1.1 ∼ 2.1
        1.1 ∼ m + 0.1, m ∈ ℤ
        1.1 - (m + 0.1) = 1 - m ∈ ℤ

        1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, ...

        -1 + 0.1 = -0.9, -1.9, -2.9, ...

        All related to 1.1

        Is this an equivalence relation?

        Check the three conditions:
            1. Is x ∼ x  ∀x ∈ ℝ?
                x ∼ x if x - x ∈ ℤ but x - x = 0 ∈ ℤ

            2. If x ∼ y is y ∼ x?
                If x ∼ y then
                    x - y ∈ ℤ
                ie x - y = m for some m ∈ ℤ
                    y - x = -(x - y) = -m ∈ ℤ
                        since m ∈ ℤ
                            so y ∼ x

            3. If x ∼ y and y ∼ z is x ∼ z?
                If x ∼ y then ∃n ∈ ℤ such that x - y = n

                If y ∼ z then ∃m ∈ ℤ such that y - z = m

                x - z = x - y + y - z = n + m ∈ ℤ

            So our relation is an equivalence relation on ℝ

    Defⁿ:
        If ∼ is an equivalence relation on A and if a ∈ A we define the equivalence class of a to be:
            [a] = {x ∈ A | x ∼ a}

        In previous example:
            [1.1] = {x ∈ ℝ | x = 1.1 + m, m ∈ ℤ}
                  = {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, ..., -0.9, -1.9, ...}

        Notice 3.1 ∼ 4.1:
            3.1 - 4.1 = -1 ∈ ℤ

        [Hamlet] = {all books written by William Shakespeare}

        Note:
            In an equivalence relation a ∼ a, so a ∈ [a] always
            ie [a] ≠ ∅

    Thm 1.49:
        Let A be a set and ∼ an equivalence relation on A

        If x, z ∈ A
            then [x] = [z] if and only if x ∼ z (⇒ and ⇐)

    Proof:
        We need to prove:
            1. If x ∼ z then [x] = [z]
            2. If [x] = [z] then x ∼ z

        Proof of 1:
            Suppose x ∼ z and prove [x] = [z]
            
            To prove [x] = [z] we need to show:
                [x] ∈ [z] and [z] ∈ [x]
                since [x] and [z] are sets

                    A. Try to show [x] ∈ [z] if x ∼z
                        Let y ∈ [x] and show y ∈ [z]

                        We know x ∼ z and y ∈ [x]
                            so x ∼ y

                        x ∼ z means z ∼ x by symmetry

                        We have z ∼ x and x ∼ y so z ∼ y
                            so y ∈ [z]

                        So if x ∼ z then [x] ∈ [z]

                    B. To show [z] ∈ [x]:
                        Let w ∈ [z] and show w ∈ [x]
                            w ∈ [z] so w ∼ z and x ∼ z or z ∼ x

                        So w ∼ z and z ∼ x
                            ⇒ w ∼ x by transitivity

                        So w ∈ [x]

                        If x ∼ z then [z] ∈ [x]

                    Putting A. and B. together:
                        If x ∼ z then [x] = [z]

                        So 1. is proved

        Proof of 2:
            Show if [x] = [z] then x ∼ z
            
            If [x] = [z] then
                We know x ∈ [x]
                    [x] = [z]

                So x ∈ [z] ⇒ x ∼ z by definition

    Equivalence relation:
        ~ relation on a set A withe the properties:
            1. x ~ x ∀x ∈ A (reflexivity)
            2. If x ~ y then y ~ x (symmetry)
            3. If x ~ y and y ~ z then x ~ z (transitivity)

        If ~ is an equivalence relation:
            [a] = {x ∈ A | x ~ a}
            a ∈ [a] so [a] ≠ ∅

        Showed:
            [x] = [z] if and only if x ~ z

    Cor 1.50:
        Let A be a set and ~ an equivalence relation on A.

        Let x, z ∈ A
            then either [x] = [z] or [x] ∩ [z] ≠ ∅

    Proof:
        Suppose [x] ∩ [z] ≠ ∅

        So ∃y such that y ∈ [x] ∩ [z]

        So y ∈ [x] and y = [z]
        ie y ~ x and y ~ z
        so x ~ y and y ~ z
        so x ~ z by transitivity
        ie [x] = [z]

    These equivalence classes cover all of A since each a ∈ [a] with no overlaps

    Let E be the set of equivalence classes of ~

    E = {[a] | a ∈ A}

    ⋃a ∈ A [a] = A
    and [a] ∩ [b] = ∅
    if a ≁ b

    Defⁿ:
        A partition of a set A is a collection of disjoint subset of A
        whose union is all of A

        Our equivalence classes of ~ form a partition of A

    Example:
        Let A be the set of counties in Ireland

        Let:
            A₁ = {counties in Munster}
            A₂ = {counties in Leinster}
            A₃ = {counties in Ulster}
            A₄ = {counties in Connacht}

        A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₄ = A
        and Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ = ∅ if i ≠ j

        {A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄} is a partition of A

        We saw that equivalence relations give us partitions

        Now we can see that given a partition of A
        we can define an equivalence relation on A
        which has equivalence classes exactly equal to the sets in our partition

        Let D = {Aᵢ} where Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ = ∅ if i ≠ j
        ie D is a partition of A 

        Put an equivalence on D such that the Aᵢ's are the equiv classes

        Define x ~D y if x, y ∈ Aᵢ for some i is ~D an equiv relation on A?

        1. Is x ~D x?
            x ∈ A = ∪Aᵢ ⇒ x ∈ Aᵢ for some i

        2. If x ~D y, is y ~D x?
            x ~D y ⇒ ∃ j such that x, y ∈ Aⱼ
            so y, x ∈ Aⱼ ⇒ y ~D x

        3. If x ~D y and y ~D z is x ~D z
            x ~D y ⇒ ∃i such that x, y ∈ Aᵢ
            y ~D z ⇒ ∃j such that z, y ∈ Aⱼ
                y ∈ Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ ⇒ i = j (otherwise Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ = ∅)

            ⇒ x ∈ Aᵢ, z ∈ Aᵢ
            ⇒ x ~D z

§ 1.4 - Cardinality
    Cardinality <-> size

    A = {a, b, c} <-> {cat, dog, mouse}

    {1, 2, 3, ..., n}
    <-> A bijection

    If A and B are finite sets, we can see that there is a bijection between them
    if and only if A and B have the same number of elements (Prove)

    Defⁿ:
        Let x and y be two sets we say x is numerically equivalent to y(or has the same cardinality as y)
        ∃f: x -> y which is a bijection

    Example:
        1. If A = {a, b, c}, B = {1, 2, 3}
            f: B -> A 

            f(1) = a
            f(2) = b
            f(3) = c

            is a bijection

        2. A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = {counties in Munster}
            f: A -> B

            f(1) = Cork, ...

            f is a bijection
                A, B are numerically equivalent

        3. Let A = ℕ, B = {2, 4, 6, 8}
            f: A -> B

            f(n) = 2n is a bijection

            So ℕ and the even numbers are numerically equivalent or have same cardinality

        4. Galileo noticed

            1 -> 1²
            2 -> 2² = 4
            ...
            n -> n²

            gives a bijection from ℕ to the perfect squares

            So they have same cardinality

        Defⁿ:
            We say a set A is finite if ∃ a bijection

            f:{1, 2, 3, ..., n} -> A
            for some n ∈ ℕ

            OOtherwise we say A is infinite
